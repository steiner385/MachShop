## 📋 Test Coverage Summary

### TypeScript Compilation: ✅ PASS

All new files compile with **zero TypeScript errors**:

```bash
# Verified files:
✅ frontend/src/hooks/usePresence.ts
✅ frontend/src/hooks/useRoutingChangeDetection.ts
✅ frontend/src/components/Routing/ActiveUsersIndicator.tsx
✅ frontend/src/components/Routing/RoutingChangedAlert.tsx
✅ frontend/src/components/Routing/GanttChartView.tsx

```

### Unit Tests: ✅ PASS (34/35)

**Routing Service Tests**: `src/tests/services/RoutingService.test.ts`

```bash
npm test -- src/tests/services/RoutingService.test.ts

Results:
✓ 34 tests passed
⊘ 1 test skipped (circular dependency - flaky test)
✓ Optimistic locking tests passing
✓ Version conflict detection working
```

**Key Passing Tests**:
- ✅ should successfully update when currentVersion matches
- ✅ should throw VersionConflictError when currentVersion does not match
- ✅ should update routing without version check if currentVersion not provided

## 🎯 Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Presence Tracking
- [ ] Navigate to any routing detail page
- [ ] Verify ActiveUsersIndicator appears in header
- [ ] Open same routing in another browser/tab
- [ ] Verify both sessions show each other's presence
- [ ] Close one tab, verify presence disappears after ~60s

### 2. View Toggle
- [ ] Navigate to routing detail, click Steps tab
- [ ] Verify segmented control shows three options: Table/Graph/Gantt
- [ ] Click each view option
- [ ] Verify view changes instantly without errors
- [ ] Verify each view renders correctly

### 3. Gantt Chart
- [ ] Switch to Gantt Chart view
- [ ] Verify timeline displays with time markers
- [ ] Verify bars are color-coded correctly
- [ ] Hover over bars to see tooltips
- [ ] Verify total duration is calculated
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile

### 4. Change Detection
- [ ] **User A**: Open routing in Browser 1
- [ ] **User B**: Open same routing in Browser 2
- [ ] **User B**: Modify and save the routing
- [ ] **User A**: Wait 30 seconds
- [ ] Verify alert appears showing routing was modified
- [ ] Click "Reload Latest Version"
- [ ] Verify routing reloads with User B's changes

### 5. Optimistic Locking
- [ ] **User A**: Open routing (version 1.0)
- [ ] **User B**: Open same routing (version 1.0)
- [ ] **User B**: Edit and save (routing becomes version 1.1)
- [ ] **User A**: Try to save changes
- [ ] Verify version conflict modal appears
- [ ] Click "Reload Latest Version"
- [ ] Verify User A gets version 1.1

## 🎨 Features to Test Manually

### 1. Presence Tracking API

```bash
# Test presence update endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3101/api/v1/presence/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "routing",
    "resourceId": "test-routing-1",
    "action": "viewing"
  }'

# Expected: {"success":true,"message":"Presence updated"}

# Test get presence endpoint
curl http://localhost:3101/api/v1/presence/routing/test-routing-1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Expected: {"success":true,"data":{"resourceId":"test-routing-1","activeUsers":[...]}}
```

### 2. Visual Testing

1. **Login** as Manufacturing Engineer
2. Navigate to **Routings** page
3. Open any routing
4. Click **Steps** tab
5. Test each feature systematically

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance metrics:

| Operation | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Page Load | < 10s | Initial routing detail load |
| View Switch | < 2s | Table ↔ Graph ↔ Gantt |
| Gantt Render | < 2s | For up to 100 steps |
| Presence Update | 30s | Heartbeat interval |
| Change Detection | 30s | Polling interval |
| API Response | < 500ms | All REST endpoints |

## 🔍 Known Limitations

1. **Presence Tracking**
   - ⚠️ In-memory storage (single server only)
   - ℹ️ For production with multiple servers, upgrade to Redis
   - ℹ️ 60-second stale timeout (configurable)

2. **Change Detection**
   - ⚠️ Polling-based (30-second interval)
   - ℹ️ For real-time updates, consider WebSockets
   - ℹ️ Only tracks version changes (not who's editing what field)

3. **Gantt Chart**
   - ⚠️ Sequential execution only (no parallel steps visualization)
   - ℹ️ Recommended max 100 steps for good performance
   - ℹ️ No interactive editing (read-only)

4. **View Toggle**
   - ℹ️ View preference not persisted across sessions
   - ℹ️ No split-screen mode (one view at a time)

## 🎉 Success Criteria
