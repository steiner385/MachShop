John Doe, a production operator, logs into the Manufacturing Execution System to begin his shift. The dashboard immediately shows his assigned work orders, prioritized by due date and status. He selects work order WO-2024-001003, a compressor disk currently in progress. The system displays comprehensive work order details including part information, quantities, and most importantly, the complete operation sequence. Each operation shows its status, progress, and specific requirements. John clicks on Operation 10, the Forging operation, to view detailed execution information. The system shows him exactly what needs to be done: 5 units ordered, with real-time tracking of completed and scrapped quantities. The operation is marked complete, showing 100% progress with all 5 units successfully forged. This level of visibility and control ensures quality, maintains traceability, and keeps production flowing smoothly. No paper travelers. No guesswork.
