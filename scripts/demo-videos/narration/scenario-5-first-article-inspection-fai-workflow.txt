A new aerospace part requires First Article Inspection. Quality Engineer Rachel starts the digital FAI process. The system automatically balloons the drawing, identifying every feature that requires measurement. Rachel performs measurements, and the system validates against specifications in real-time. When a non-conformance is detected, the system ensures proper documentation and approval. With all measurements complete and deviations documented, the system generates the full AS9102 package automatically. Complete AS9102 compliance in a fraction of the time. Automated documentation. Zero errors.
