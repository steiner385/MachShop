Modern manufacturing isn't about isolated systems. It's about seamless integration. Watch how this MES connects everything. When a sales order is entered in the ERP, the MES automatically creates production schedules and work orders. The MES communicates directly with production equipment through B2M protocol, collecting data in real-time. Measurement data from CMMs, calipers, and test equipment flows directly into quality records. All MES data flows to analytics platforms, turning production data into business insights. When production completes, the MES updates the warehouse system and triggers shipping. From order to shipment, every system connected. Every process optimized. That's smart manufacturing.
