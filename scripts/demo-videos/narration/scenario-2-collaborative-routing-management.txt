Meet Mike and Jennifer, manufacturing engineers tasked with reducing cycle time for Widget A by 15%. The Gantt chart view visualizes the entire process, making bottlenecks obvious. Jennifer joins the routing. The system shows Mike she's here, preventing conflicting changes. They reconfigure the routing together, with all changes automatically tracked. Before activating, they review all changes and run a validation check. The new routing is instantly available to operators, and work orders automatically update.
