Tom arrives at Assembly Station 3 and starts his shift. No more paper travelers or clipboards. The system shows Tom exactly what needs to be done, prioritized by due date. Digital work instructions guide Tom through each step with photos, videos, and automated data collection. Built-in quality checkpoints prevent defects from moving forward. When Tom finishes, the system updates inventory, notifies the next operation, and creates a complete quality record. No paperwork. No data entry errors. Complete traceability. That's the future of manufacturing.
