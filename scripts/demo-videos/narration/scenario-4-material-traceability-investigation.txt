A customer reports a bearing failure in Widget A. Quality Engineer Linda needs to find the root causeâ€”fast. The genealogy tree shows the complete history of this product and every material that went into it. Linda searches for other products using bearings from the same lot. Drilling deeper, Linda discovers the assembly process used higher-than-spec torque for position 1. With the root cause identified, Linda immediately takes action. Five minutes. Complete root cause analysis. Proactive containment. That's the power of digital traceability.
