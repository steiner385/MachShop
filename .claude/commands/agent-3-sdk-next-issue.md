# Agent 3: SDK Licensing & Documentation - License Management, Documentation, Optional Features

You are Agent 3 of a three-agent team building the MachShop SDK/Extension platform. Your focus is on **license management system, comprehensive SDK documentation, and optional advanced features**.

## Your Task Queue (in priority order):

1. **Issue #413** - Extension License Management System (8 pts) - Requires #403 ✓
2. **Issue #436** - Comprehensive SDK Documentation & Reference Examples (6 pts) - Shared with Agent 2
3. **Optional Issues** (Advanced features, see below)

---

## ⚠️ DEPENDENCIES

**Critical Dependency: Issue #403 (Extension Type Taxonomy)**
- Agent 1 must complete #403 before you can efficiently start
- Once #403 is published, you can begin work on #413 independently
- **#436 Documentation**: Shared with Agent 2, can start once all other features are implemented

### What This Issue Requires

Create comprehensive license management system for controlling extension usage:

1. **License Types**
   - Community (free, open source)

   - Custom (negotiated terms)

2. **License Validation Engine**
   - License key verification (cryptographic)
   - Expiration checking
   - Feature entitlement checking
   - Site limit validation (how many sites can use)
   - User limit validation (how many concurrent users)
   - Component licensing (per feature/module)

3. **License Enforcement**
   - Feature gating (disable features without license)
   - Rate limiting per license tier
   - Watermarking/branding per tier
   - License violation reporting
   - Graceful degradation when expired

4. **License Management UI/Services**
   - License registration
   - License renewal workflow
   - License transfer between sites

   - Offline license validation (cached)
   - License revocation
   - License usage tracking
   - Telemetry and analytics

  ├─ Revocation handler
  ├─ Telemetry collection
  └─ Error handling and fallbacks

Step 5: Testing & Documentation (1 day)
  ├─ 50+ license validation test cases
  ├─ Tier-specific feature tests
  ├─ Offline mode tests
  ├─ LICENSE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md
  └─ Integration examples
```

### Key Files to Create

- `packages/extension-sdk/src/licensing/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/licensing/validator.ts` - License validation
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/licensing/enforcer.ts` - License enforcement

- `packages/extension-sdk/src/licensing/server-client.ts` - Server integration
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/licensing/LICENSE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Guide

### Output Deliverables

- License validation engine with cryptographic verification
- Feature entitlement system supporting per-component licensing
- License enforcement with rate limiting and feature gating
- License management services (registration, renewal, transfer)
- Server integration with offline support
- 50+ test cases covering all license scenarios
- Comprehensive guide with enterprise scenarios

## Integration Points

Agent 3's work integrates with:

- **Agent 1's #403**: Uses type system and manifest definitions
- **Agent 2's #405**: Dependencies used in license enforcement
- **Agent 2's #407**: Multi-site deployments must respect licenses
- **Agent 2's #436**: Coordinates on documentation
- **Core MachShop**: License server, telemetry, user management

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Issue #413 implemented with comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
✅ Clear separation of concerns (validation, enforcement, management)
✅ Type-safe APIs throughout
✅ Cryptographic security for license keys
✅ Offline support with graceful degradation
✅ Comprehensive license guide with enterprise scenarios
✅ Documentation integrated with Agent 2's work
✅ All PRs merged and documented
✅ Ready for future enterprise features

---

## Team Coordination Notes

- **Wait for Agent 1's #403** to complete before starting #413 efficiently
- **No dependencies on Agent 2's issues** - can work independently
- **Coordinate with Agent 2 on #436** - split documentation responsibilities
- **Optional issues** only if time permits after main queue complete
- **Enterprise customers depend on this work** - high priority for adoption

## Ready to Begin?

Once Agent 1 completes Issue #403, you can start with:

```bash
/implement-next-gh-issue
```

This will step you through your queue starting with Issue #413.
