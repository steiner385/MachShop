# Agent 2: SDK Dependency & Deployment - Dependency Resolution, Multi-Site, Documentation

You are Agent 2 of a three-agent team building the MachShop SDK/Extension platform. Your focus is on **dependency resolution, multi-site deployment strategies, and comprehensive SDK documentation**.

## Your Task Queue (in priority order):

1. **Issue #405** - Extension Dependency Resolution Engine (7 pts) - Requires #403 ✓
2. **Issue #407** - Multi-Site Extension Deployment Service (8 pts) - Requires #403, #404 ✓
3. **Issue #436** - Comprehensive SDK Documentation & Reference Examples (6 pts) - Shared with Agent 3

---

## ⚠️ DEPENDENCIES

**Critical Dependency: Issue #403 (Extension Type Taxonomy)**
- Agent 1 must complete #403 before you can efficiently start
- Once #403 is published, you can begin work on #405 and #407 independently
- **Do not wait for #404 or #409** - your issues only need #403

**For Issue #436 (Documentation):**
- Shared task with Agent 3
- You handle: SDK core patterns, extension development guide, best practices
- Agent 3 handles: License management patterns, advanced scenarios
- Can start in parallel once all other features are implemented

## Issue #405: Extension Dependency Resolution Engine

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH
**Value:** 9/10 | **Effort:** 7/10 | **Ratio:** 1.29 ⭐⭐
**Dependencies:** #403 ✓
**Blocks:** None (enabler for #414)
**Timeline:** Week 2-4

### What This Issue Requires

Create sophisticated dependency resolution engine for managing extension dependencies:

1. **Dependency Graph Builder**
   - Parse extension dependencies from manifests
   - Build directed acyclic graph (DAG)
   - Detect circular dependencies
   - Topological sorting for installation order
   - Dependency visualization

2. **Version Resolution**
   - Resolve version ranges (^1.0, ~1.2, >=1.0.0)
   - Find compatible versions across dependency tree
   - Handle diamond dependencies (A→B, A→C, both→D)
   - Conflict resolution strategies (highest version, latest compatible)
   - Fallback strategies when resolution fails

3. **Installation Planner**
   - Generate installation order
   - Identify optional vs required dependencies
   - Peer dependency handling
   - Transitive dependency tracking
   - Installation plan visualization

4. **Dependency Validator**
   - Validate resolved dependencies before install
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Verify version compatibility
   - Check platform version requirements
   - Generate detailed error reports

### Implementation Steps

```
Step 1: Dependency Graph System (1-2 days)
  ├─ Create types.ts with graph structures
  ├─ Build dependency parser
  ├─ Implement graph builder
  ├─ Add circular dependency detection
  └─ Visualization/serialization

Step 2: Version Resolution (2-3 days)
  ├─ Implement semver range parser
  ├─ Version compatibility resolver
  ├─ Diamond dependency handler
  ├─ Conflict resolution strategies
  └─ Fallback mechanisms

Step 3: Installation Planner (1-2 days)
  ├─ Topological sort for install order
  ├─ Optional dependency handling
  ├─ Peer dependency processor
  ├─ Installation plan generator
  └─ Plan visualization

Step 4: Validator & Testing (1 day)
  ├─ Dependency validator service
  ├─ 50+ resolution test cases
  ├─ DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md
  └─ API reference with examples
```

### Key Files to Create

- `packages/extension-sdk/src/dependencies/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/dependencies/graph.ts` - Graph builder
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/dependencies/resolver.ts` - Version resolver
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/dependencies/planner.ts` - Installation planner
- `packages/extension-sdk/src/dependencies/DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md` - Guide

## Issue #407: Multi-Site Extension Deployment Service

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH
**Value:** 8/10 | **Effort:** 8/10 | **Ratio:** 1.0 ⭐⭐
**Dependencies:** #403 ✓, #404 (when available)
**Blocks:** #414
**Timeline:** Week 2-4 (parallel with #405)

### What This Issue Requires

Create service for deploying extensions across multiple MachShop instances/sites:

1. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Centralized deployment (push from control center)
   - Distributed deployment (pull from each site)
   - Staged rollout (canary/blue-green deployments)
   - Rollback strategies
   - Health check integration

2. **Site Management**
   - Site registry (list of all MachShop instances)
   - Site grouping (production, staging, development)
   - Site-specific configuration
   - Site status monitoring
   - Deployment history per site

3. **Deployment Orchestration**
   - Deployment plan generation
   - Dependency resolution per site
   - Conflict detection across sites
   - Deployment scheduling
   - Progress tracking and reporting

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Site-specific extension config
   - Environment variable mapping
   - Feature flag per site
   - Config override hierarchy
   - Config validation per site

## Issue #436: Comprehensive SDK Documentation & Reference Examples (Shared with Agent 3)

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH
**Value:** 9/10 | **Effort:** 6/10 | **Ratio:** 1.5 ⭐⭐⭐
**Dependencies:** #403, #405, #407, #413, others
**Timeline:** Week 4-6 (after other features implemented)

### Agent 2's Documentation Responsibilities

- Extension development quickstart guide
- Dependency management and resolution examples
- Multi-site deployment walkthrough
- Best practices for extension architecture
- Common patterns and anti-patterns
- Performance optimization guide
- Troubleshooting guide

---

## Integration Points

Agent 2's work integrates with:

- **Agent 1's #403**: Uses type system and manifest definitions
- **Agent 1's #404**: Uses compatibility checker for version resolution
- **Agent 1's #409**: Uses conflict detection for multi-site scenarios
- **Agent 3's #413**: Coordinates on Issue #436 documentation
- **Issue #414**: Multi-site deployment service enables this tool

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All issues implemented with comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Type-safe APIs throughout
✅ Performance optimizations
✅ Comprehensive guides with examples
✅ All PRs merged and documented
✅ Ready for Issue #414 (Migration Tool)

---

## Team Coordination Notes

- **Wait for Agent 1's #403** to complete before starting #405/#407 efficiently
- **Can start #405 and #407 in parallel** - they have no interdependencies
- **Coordinate with Agent 3 on #436** - split documentation responsibilities
- **Agent 1's #404 and #409 not blockers** - nice to have but not required to start

## Ready to Begin?

Once Agent 1 completes Issue #403, you can start with:

```bash
/implement-next-gh-issue
```

This will step you through your queue starting with Issue #405.
