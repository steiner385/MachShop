# Multi-Agent SDK/Extension Platform Development

This document defines independent work streams for three parallel agents focused on building the MachShop SDK, extension system, and low-code/no-code platform capabilities. Each agent works on non-conflicting issues to enable rapid parallel development.

## Strategic Vision

Build a comprehensive SDK/extension ecosystem that enables:
- Custom entity and field definitions without core code changes
- Multi-site deployment with per-site customization
- Low-code/no-code configuration capabilities
- Third-party extension marketplace
- Complete extensibility of all MES capabilities

## Conflict Avoidance Strategy

✅ **Functional Area Isolation**: Each agent works on different SDK subsystems
- Agent 1: Database Documentation + Frontend/Lifecycle Infrastructure
- Agent 2: Database Documentation + Security Foundation
- Agent 3: Database Documentation Completion

✅ **No Dependency Conflicts**: All initial tasks have resolved dependencies

✅ **Data Model Separation**: Each documentation effort targets different attributes
- Business context, technical specs, examples, compliance, integration mapping
- All operating on the same 186 tables but different metadata attributes

✅ **Independent Framework Components**: Foundation issues don't block each other

## Running Agent Tasks

Each agent can use their respective Claude Code command:

```bash
# Agent 1 - Database Documentation (Business + Tech) + Frontend/Lifecycle
/agent-1-sdk-next-issue

# Agent 2 - Database Documentation (Examples + Compliance) + Security
/agent-2-sdk-next-issue

# Agent 3 - Database Documentation (Integration Mapping)
/agent-3-sdk-next-issue
```

These commands will:
1. Display the next issue in the agent's queue
2. Ask for confirmation
3. Automatically prune the issue from the list after completion
4. Execute `/implement-gh-issue <number>` to implement it
5. Update this document with completion status

### Database Documentation Layers:

All 5 documentation issues work on the same 3,536 database fields across 186 tables, each adding different metadata:

1. **Business Context** (#213, Agent 1) - Why does this field exist?
2. **Technical Specs** (#214, Agent 1) - How is this field structured?
3. **Examples & Values** (#215, Agent 2) - What are valid values?
4. **Compliance** (#216, Agent 2) - What regulations affect this?
5. **Integration Mapping** (#217, Agent 3) - How does this connect externally?

Together, these create a complete "Rosetta Stone" for SDK developers understanding the system.
