# Multi-Agent SDK Platform Development Setup

## Quick Start

Three agents are ready to work in parallel on building the MachShop SDK/Extension/Low-Code-No-Code platform. Each agent has independent work streams with **zero conflicts** and **no blocking dependencies**.

### Commands to Launch

```bash
# Agent 1 - Database Documentation + Frontend/Lifecycle Infrastructure
/agent-1-sdk-next-issue

# Agent 2 - Database Documentation + Security Foundation
/agent-2-sdk-next-issue

# Agent 3 - Database Documentation Completion
/agent-3-sdk-next-issue
```

Each command will:
1. Display the next issue from the agent's queue
2. Ask for confirmation
3. Execute `/implement-gh-issue <number>` to implement it
4. Report completion and prune from queue
5. Be ready for next iteration

## Agent Distribution

### Agent 1: Database Documentation + Frontend/Lifecycle (30 story points)
**Issues**: #213, #214, #426, #434

**What they build**:
- Business context documentation (why does each field exist?)
- Technical specifications documentation (how is each field structured?)
- Frontend Extension SDK with Ant Design components for low-code UI building
- Extension lifecycle management and versioning system

**Impact**:
- Makes SDK discoverable through comprehensive documentation
- Enables frontend extensions without modifying core UI code
- Unblocks dynamic route registration (#439) and service DI container (#440)

### Agent 2: Database Documentation + Security Foundation (21 story points)
**Issues**: #215, #216, #437

**What they build**:
- Examples and valid values documentation
- Compliance and governance documentation
- Extension security model with sandboxing

**Impact**:
- Provides practical examples for SDK developers
- Ensures extensions respect regulatory requirements
- Creates security foundation preventing malicious/buggy extensions
- Unblocks extension security review framework (#444)

### Agent 3: Database Documentation Completion (6 story points)
**Issues**: #217

**What they build**:
- Integration mapping documentation (connects all fields to external systems)

**Impact**:
- Completes the "Rosetta Stone" for SDK developers
- Documents how MachShop data flows to/from external systems
- Enables custom integrations via extensions

## Conflict Avoidance

✅ **Functional Separation**:
- Agent 1: Business context + Technical specs + Frontend/Lifecycle
- Agent 2: Examples + Compliance + Security
- Agent 3: Integration mapping

✅ **Database Documentation Strategy**:
- All 5 documentation issues work on the same 3,536 fields across 186 tables
- Each issue targets different metadata attributes (business context, technical specs, examples, compliance, integration mapping)
- Can be done independently without conflicts

✅ **Framework Components**:
- #426 (Frontend SDK) - independent, no shared dependencies
- #434 (Extension Lifecycle) - independent, no shared dependencies
- #437 (Extension Security) - independent, no shared dependencies

✅ **No Blocking Dependencies**:
- All initial 8 tasks have resolved dependencies
- No task in one agent's queue depends on another agent's tasks

## Phase Progression

### Phase 1 (Current): Foundation & Documentation (8 issues, 57 pts)
- [ ] Agent 1 completes: #213, #214, #426, #434
- [ ] Agent 2 completes: #215, #216, #437
- [ ] Agent 3 completes: #217

**Unlocks Phase 2**:
- #439 (Dynamic Route Registration) - depends on #426, #405
- #440 (Service Locator & DI) - depends on #434
- #444 (Security Review Framework) - depends on #437

### Phase 2: Advanced Framework (planned after Phase 1)
- Custom entity and enum definitions without code changes
- Dynamic route registration for extension APIs
- Advanced hook system enhancements
- Dependency resolution and conflict detection

### Phase 3: Marketplace & Ecosystem
- Extension security code review framework
- License management system
- Analytics and monitoring
- Third-party extension marketplace

## Documentation Value

The 5-layer documentation pyramid (3,536 fields across 186 tables):

```
Layer 5: Integration Mapping (Agent 3, #217)
  ↓ "How do fields connect to external systems?"
Layer 4: Compliance & Governance (Agent 2, #216)
  ↓ "What regulations affect this field?"
Layer 3: Examples & Valid Values (Agent 2, #215)
  ↓ "What are real values for this field?"
Layer 2: Technical Specifications (Agent 1, #214)
  ↓ "How is this field technically implemented?"
Layer 1: Business Context (Agent 1, #213)
  ↓ "Why does this field exist?"
COMPLETE SDK KNOWLEDGE BASE
```

Result: Complete "Rosetta Stone" for building extensions with full context

---

## Timeline Estimates

- **Agent 1**: ~30 story points = ~7-8 weeks
- **Agent 2**: ~21 story points = ~5-6 weeks
- **Agent 3**: ~6 story points = ~1-2 weeks

**Key Insight**: Agent 3 finishes first and becomes available for Phase 2 issues that are unlocked by Agent 1 & 2's completions.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 1 Success Metrics**:
- [ ] 5 comprehensive documentation layers published covering all 3,536 database fields
- [ ] Frontend Extension SDK with working examples
- [ ] Extension lifecycle management system in production
- [ ] Extension security model preventing unauthorized code execution
- [ ] Phase 2 critical issues (#439, #440, #444) unblocked and ready to implement
- [ ] SDK developer documentation published
- [ ] 3 agents working in parallel with zero conflicts
- [ ] All PRs merged to main with passing tests

✅ **Platform Readiness**:
- Developers can extend MachShop without modifying core code
- Low-code/no-code extension building capabilities available
- Multi-site deployment with per-site customization
- Security-first extension validation and deployment
- Complete knowledge base for SDK adoption

## Repository Location

All agent commands are in: `/home/tony/GitHub/MachShop3/.claude/commands/`
- `agent-1-sdk-next-issue.md`
- `agent-2-sdk-next-issue.md`
- `agent-3-sdk-next-issue.md`

Detailed task tracking: `.claude/AGENT_SDK_TODO_LISTS.md`

---

## Ready to Launch!

The three agents are ready to work. You can run each command in parallel:

```bash
# Start all three agents in parallel execution
/agent-1-sdk-next-issue &
/agent-2-sdk-next-issue &
/agent-3-sdk-next-issue &

# Or run them sequentially
/agent-1-sdk-next-issue
/agent-2-sdk-next-issue
/agent-3-sdk-next-issue
```

Each agent will progress through their queue independently, reporting completion after each issue. Run the same command again to move to the next task in the queue.
