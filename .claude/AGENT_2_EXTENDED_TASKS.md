## Blocking Relationships

```
Issue #444 (Security Review)
  ↑
Issue #437 ✓ COMPLETED

Issue #440 (DI Container)
  ↓
Issue #441 (Events) ← depends on DI
Issue #442 (Data Access) ← depends on DI

Issue #438 (Database Schema)
  ↑
Issues #405, #409 (other framework pieces)

Issue #436 (Documentation)
  ↑
Issues #437, #438, #439, #440 (needed for docs)
```

---

## Parallel Track Strategy

**To Maximize Efficiency:**

- Start #444 and #440 immediately in parallel (7 + 5 = 12 pts)
- Start #435 (Developer CLI) in parallel with above since it has no dependencies
- Once #440 completes, start #441 and #442 in parallel
- #433 and #436 can start once main framework is in place

This parallelization reduces the 57-point backlog from 8 weeks (sequential) to ~4 weeks (aggressive parallel)
