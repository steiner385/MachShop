# Welcome to MES Developer Portal

Build powerful integrations and plugins for the Manufacturing Execution System. This portal provides everything you need to get started with MES APIs, webhooks, and the plugin system.

## What is MES?

The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is a comprehensive platform for managing manufacturing operations, from work order tracking to quality management and inventory control. The MES API allows external systems and custom applications to integrate seamlessly with MES operations.

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

1. **Sign up** for a developer account at [developers.mes.company.com](https://developers.mes.company.com)
2. **Get your API key** from your dashboard
3. **Make your first API call** using the quick start guide
4. **Read the docs** for your specific use case
5. **Deploy** your integration to production

**[→ Jump to 5-Minute Quick Start](./quick-start.md)**

## What You Can Build

### Integrations
