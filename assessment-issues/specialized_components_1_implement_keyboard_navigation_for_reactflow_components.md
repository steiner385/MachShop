## Specialized Component Enhancement

**Component Type:**
- [x] ReactFlow (Visual routing editor, workflow diagrams)
- [ ] D3 Visualization (Charts, graphs, traceability)
- [ ] Chart Components (Recharts, analytics)
- [ ] Monaco Editor (Code editing)
- [ ] Lexical Editor (Rich text editing)
- [ ] Complex Forms (Multi-step, dynamic forms)
- [ ] Virtualization (Large lists, tables)
- [ ] Drag & Drop (Interactive interfaces)

**Component Count:** 84 components

**Issue Category:**
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [x] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Memory leak prevention
- [ ] Mobile/touch support
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User experience enhancement

## Assessment Reference
**Assessment Report:** Phase 8 - Specialized Components Analysis
**Component Type:** ReactFlow
**Components Found:** 84

## Current Behavior
84 ReactFlow components found during Phase 8 analysis. These visual workflow editors need custom keyboard navigation for accessibility compliance.

## Technical Improvements Needed
- [ ] Custom keyboard navigation for nodes and edges
- [ ] Tab order through workflow elements
- [ ] ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for editing operations
- [ ] Focus indicators for visual elements

## Testing Requirements
- [x] Accessibility testing (keyboard, screen reader)
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Mobile/touch device testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
