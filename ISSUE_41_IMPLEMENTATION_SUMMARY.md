## Phase 1: WorkflowEnforcementService (487 lines)

### Files Created
- `src/services/WorkflowEnforcementService.ts`

### Core Components

#### Enforcement Decision Logic
```typescript
async canRecordPerformance(workOrderId: string): Promise<EnforcementDecision>
```
- Checks if work performance can be recorded
- Validates against configured enforcement mode
- Returns decision object with warnings and bypasses
- Supports STRICT, FLEXIBLE, HYBRID modes

#### Operation Control
```typescript
async canStartOperation(workOrderId: string, operationId: string): Promise<EnforcementDecision>
async canCompleteOperation(workOrderId: string, operationId: string): Promise<EnforcementDecision>
```
- Validates operation state transitions
- Ensures operations are in correct status before transitions

#### Prerequisite Validation
```typescript
async validatePrerequisites(
  workOrderId: string,
  operationId: string,
  enforceMode: 'STRICT' | 'FLEXIBLE'
): Promise<PrerequisiteValidation>
```
- Traverses RoutingStepDependency models
- Checks prerequisite operation completion status
- Returns unmet prerequisites with detailed reasons
- STRICT mode: blocks if prerequisites unmet
- FLEXIBLE mode: warns but allows

#### Status Validation
```typescript
async validateWorkOrderStatus(
  workOrderId: string,
  requiredStatuses: WorkOrderStatus[]
): Promise<StatusValidation>
```
- Validates work order against required statuses
- Provides detailed validation results

### Type Definitions

**EnforcementDecision**
- `allowed: boolean` - Whether action is permitted
- `reason?: string` - Explanation if blocked
- `warnings: string[]` - Warnings for bypasses
- `configMode: WorkflowMode` - Mode used for decision
- `bypassesApplied: string[]` - Rules that were bypassed
- `appliedAt: Date` - Decision timestamp

**PrerequisiteValidation**
- `valid: boolean` - Whether all prerequisites met (STRICT) or just for tracking (FLEXIBLE)
- `unmetPrerequisites: UnmetPrerequisite[]` - List of unmet prerequisites
- `warnings: string[]` - Warnings about bypassed prerequisites

**UnmetPrerequisite**
- `prerequisiteOperationId: string` - ID of unmet prerequisite operation
- `prerequisiteOperationName: string` - Operation name
- `dependencyType: DependencyType` - Type of dependency (SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL, CONDITIONAL)
- `reason: string` - Why prerequisite is unmet

### Key Features
- ✅ Configuration-driven enforcement decisions
- ✅ Multiple workflow modes (STRICT, FLEXIBLE, HYBRID)
- ✅ Comprehensive decision tracking
- ✅ Prerequisite validation with dependency traversal
- ✅ Full audit trail capability
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing code

---

## Phase 2: Database Model and Schema Changes

### Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added WorkflowEnforcementAudit model and relations

### WorkflowEnforcementAudit Model

```prisma
model WorkflowEnforcementAudit {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  workOrderId       String
  operationId       String?
  action            String   // 'RECORD_PERFORMANCE', 'START_OPERATION', 'COMPLETE_OPERATION'
  enforcementMode   String   // 'STRICT', 'FLEXIBLE', 'HYBRID'
  bypassesApplied   String[]
  warnings          String[]
  decision          Json     // Full enforcement decision object
  userId            String?
  justification     String?
  timestamp         DateTime @default(now())
  workOrder         WorkOrder @relation(...)

  @@index([workOrderId])
  @@index([operationId])
  @@index([timestamp])
  @@index([enforcementMode])
  @@map("workflow_enforcement_audits")
}
```

### Schema Relationships
- Added `enforcementAudits WorkflowEnforcementAudit[]` relation to WorkOrder
- Enables querying all enforcement decisions for a work order
- Supports compliance and audit trail requirements

### Other Changes
- Fixed duplicate field definitions in EngineeringChangeOrder model
- Improved schema consistency

---

## Pending Implementation Phases

### Phase 3: WorkOrderExecutionService Integration

**Scope:**
- Inject WorkflowEnforcementService into WorkOrderExecutionService
- Refactor `recordWorkPerformance()` to use enforcement checks
- Add `startOperation()` method with enforcement validation
- Add `completeOperation()` method with enforcement validation
- Update all status transition methods
- Log enforcement bypasses to audit table

**Example Integration:**
```typescript
async recordWorkPerformance(workOrderId: string, performanceData: any) {
  // Check enforcement configuration
  const enforcement = await this.enforcementService.canRecordPerformance(workOrderId);

  if (!enforcement.allowed) {
    throw new Error(enforcement.reason);
  }

  // Log warnings if bypasses applied
  if (enforcement.warnings.length > 0) {
    await this.recordEnforcementBypass(workOrderId, enforcement);
  }

  // Continue with performance recording...
  return await prisma.workPerformance.create({...});
}
```

### Phase 4: API Endpoints

**Endpoints to Create:**

```
GET  /api/v1/work-order-execution/:id/can-record-performance
     Response: { allowed: boolean, reason?: string, warnings: [] }

GET  /api/v1/work-order-execution/:id/operations/:opId/can-start
     Response: { allowed: boolean, reason?: string, warnings: [] }

GET  /api/v1/work-order-execution/:id/operations/:opId/can-complete
     Response: { allowed: boolean, reason?: string, warnings: [] }

GET  /api/v1/work-order-execution/:id/enforcement-audit
     Response: { audits: WorkflowEnforcementAudit[], total: number }

GET  /api/v1/work-order-execution/:id/enforcement-audit/:auditId
     Response: { audit: WorkflowEnforcementAudit }
```

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing

**Unit Tests Required:**
- EnforcementService decision logic
- Configuration-based rule application
- Prerequisite dependency validation
- Status validation logic
- Edge cases and error handling

**Integration Tests Required:**
- End-to-end enforcement with real configurations
- Prerequisite validation with complex routing
- Audit logging functionality
- API endpoint behavior
- Database consistency

**E2E Tests Required:**
- Record performance in STRICT mode (requires IN_PROGRESS)
- Record performance in FLEXIBLE mode (allows CREATED status)
- Start operation with/without prerequisites
- Complete operation validation
- Audit trail verification

**Test Coverage Goals:**
- >95% for enforcement service
- >90% for integration points
- All critical paths covered

### Phase 6: Backward Compatibility & Merge

**Verification Required:**
- All existing tests pass without modification
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- STRICT mode default (backward compatible)
- Performance regression testing
- Production readiness validation

**Merge Process:**
1. Create PR from `issue-41-flexible-enforcement-engine` branch
2. Obtain code review approval
3. Verify all CI/CD checks pass
4. Merge to main branch
5. Verify Issue #41 auto-closes
6. Update prioritization framework
7. Mark blocks as unblocked (Issues #43, #44, #45)

## Architecture & Design

### Enforcement Modes

**STRICT Mode** (Default, Backward Compatible)
- Enforces all status gating rules
- Requires IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED for data collection
- Enforces prerequisite dependencies
- Requires explicit operation start transitions
- No rule bypasses permitted

**FLEXIBLE Mode**
- Allows data collection regardless of status
- Prerequisites optional (warnings only)
- Supports auto-start on data collection
- Enables sites using external execution systems

**HYBRID Mode**
- Combines STRICT and FLEXIBLE behaviors
- Configurable per operation or work order
- Allows selective enforcement

### Configuration Integration

Uses `WorkflowConfigurationService` (Issue #40) to determine:
- `enforceStatusGating`: Apply status validation
- `enforceOperationSequence`: Apply prerequisite validation
- `requireOperationStart`: Require explicit start transition
- `workflowMode`: STRICT, FLEXIBLE, or HYBRID

### Audit Trail

Every enforcement decision is logged with:
- Action performed (RECORD_PERFORMANCE, START_OPERATION, COMPLETE_OPERATION)
- Enforcement mode applied
- Rules bypassed
- Warnings generated
- Full decision object (JSON)
- User and timestamp
- Optional justification
