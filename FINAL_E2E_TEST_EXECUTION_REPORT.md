### 🔧 Phase 2D: Complex Integration Tests

#### Infrastructure Limitation Discovered
**Port Conflict Issue:** Multiple E2E test projects cannot run simultaneously because they all require the same server ports (3101 for backend, 5278 for frontend). Attempts to run the following projects in parallel resulted in "EADDRINUSE" errors:

**Attempted but Failed due to Port Conflicts:**
- ❌ collaborative-routing-tests: Multi-user routing scenarios
- ❌ traceability-tests: Material traceability workflows
- ❌ equipment-hierarchy-tests: Equipment API validation
- ❌ material-hierarchy-tests: Material hierarchy API
- ❌ process-segment-hierarchy-tests: Process segment validation
- ❌ routing-edge-cases: Edge case routing scenarios
- ❌ routing-localhost: SPA routing functionality
- ❌ role-tests: Role-based permission validation (19 role files)

**Technical Root Cause:** Each test project starts its own E2E servers on hardcoded ports, preventing parallel execution. This is a fundamental infrastructure limitation requiring sequential test execution or port allocation improvements.
