## Issue Summary

### What Was Found
One critical issue in ProductService.deleteConfiguration() method:
- **Location**: `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/src/services/ProductService.ts` (lines 543-558)
- **Problem**: No cleanup of ConfigurationOption records before deletion
- **Impact**: Foreign key constraint violations
- **Fix**: Add explicit ConfigurationOption.deleteMany() within transaction

### Files Involved

#### Configuration Models
- **Schema**: `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 1586-1617)
  - ProductConfiguration model
  - ConfigurationOption model
  - Foreign key relationship with CASCADE delete

#### Service Layer
- **ProductService**: `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/src/services/ProductService.ts`
  - deleteConfiguration() - **FLAWED** (lines 543-558)
  - deletePart() - **CORRECT PATTERN** (lines 258-339)
  - addConfigurationOption() - **CORRECT** (lines 563-596)
  - updateConfigurationOption() - **CORRECT** (lines 601-630)
  - deleteConfigurationOption() - **CORRECT** (lines 635-650)

#### API Routes
- **ProductRoutes**: `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/src/routes/products.ts`
  - DELETE /api/v1/products/configurations/:configurationId endpoint

#### Tests
- **ProductService Tests**: `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/src/tests/services/ProductService.test.ts`
  - deleteConfiguration test (lines 825-837) - **INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE**

## Key Findings At A Glance

### Issue
```
deleteConfiguration() does not clean up ConfigurationOption records
```

### Root Cause
```
Directly deletes ProductConfiguration without handling foreign key dependency
```

### Correct Pattern (Already in Codebase)
```
Use prisma.$transaction() to:
1. Delete ConfigurationOption records first
2. Then delete ProductConfiguration
```

### Fix Complexity
```
Low - 10-15 line code change with proven pattern
```

### Error Message
```
Foreign key constraint failed on the field: `configuration_options_configurationId_fkey`
```

## Investigation Methodology

This investigation used the following approach:

1. **Schema Analysis**
   - Located ConfigurationOption and ProductConfiguration models
   - Identified foreign key relationships
   - Verified CASCADE delete configuration

2. **Code Tracing**
   - Found deleteConfiguration() method
   - Identified missing cleanup
   - Located API endpoint calling it
   - Traced test coverage

3. **Pattern Identification**
   - Found correct pattern in deletePart()
   - Compared with deleteConfiguration()
   - Verified pattern works elsewhere

4. **Impact Assessment**
   - Determined affected code paths
   - Identified test coverage gaps
   - Assessed user impact
   - Evaluated fix complexity

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive investigation report
   - Provided quick fix guide
   - Generated implementation checklist
