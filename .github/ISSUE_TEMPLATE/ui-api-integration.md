- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] Mock data in production code
- [ ] Environment configuration issues
- [ ] API call optimization needed
- [ ] Network request patterns
- [ ] Other (please describe)

**Affected Files:**
<!-- List the files where the API integration issue was found -->

## Assessment Reference
**Assessment Report:** Phase 5 - API Integration Analysis
**Details:**
- Issue Count: [number of instances]
- Severity: [High/Medium/Low]
- Category: [Configuration/Error Handling/Mock Data/etc.]

## Current Implementation
<!-- Describe the current problematic implementation -->

## Problems Identified
<!-- Choose all that apply -->
- [ ] Hardcoded localhost URLs make deployment difficult
- [ ] Missing error handling reduces user experience
- [ ] Mock data in production affects functionality
- [ ] No retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Inconsistent API call patterns
- [ ] Performance issues with API usage

## Recommended Solution

### Configuration Improvements
- [ ] Replace hardcoded URLs with environment variables
- [ ] Use centralized API configuration
- [ ] Implement proper environment handling

### Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Add try-catch blocks for API calls
- [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Implement proper loading states

### Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Remove mock data from production code
- [ ] Standardize API call patterns
- [ ] Use React Query for server state management
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript types

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
- [ ] Replace hardcoded URLs with environment variables
- [ ] Add basic error handling to all API calls

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reliability
- [ ] Implement retry logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Improve loading states

### Phase 3: Optimization
- [ ] Migrate to React Query (if not already using)
- [ ] Implement request deduplication
- [ ] Add caching strategies

## Environment Variables Needed
<!-- List the environment variables that should be created -->
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=
REACT_APP_API_TIMEOUT=
REACT_APP_API_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=
```

## API Endpoints Affected
<!-- List specific API endpoints that need attention -->

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test with different environment configurations
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test network failure conditions
- [ ] Verify removal of mock data
- [ ] Load testing if performance impact expected

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All hardcoded URLs replaced with environment variables
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Mock data removed from production code
- [ ] Tests updated to cover error scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated
