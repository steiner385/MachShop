# MES Issue Prioritization Framework
# This file defines the prioritization logic for GitHub issues to ensure
# foundational features are built before dependent features.
#
# Foundation Levels:
#   L0 (Core Infrastructure) - Must be built first, enables everything else
#   L1 (Essential Capabilities) - Core business features that depend on L0
#   L2 (Enhanced Features) - Advanced capabilities that extend L1
#   L3 (Refinements) - Nice-to-have features, optimizations, and tools

# Scoring Weights (must sum to 100)
scoring_weights:
  foundation_level: 35    # Lower level = higher priority (L0 > L1 > L2 > L3)
  dependency_status: 25   # All dependencies resolved = eligible, otherwise blocked
  strategic_alignment: 20 # Alignment with Time Tracking & Quality Management
  business_value: 10      # Customer impact and revenue potential
  effort_value_ratio: 10  # Quick wins get modest boost (value/effort)

# Strategic Focus Areas (get priority boost)
strategic_focus:
  - time_tracking
  - quality_management
