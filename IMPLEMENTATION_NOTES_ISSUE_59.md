- **Shipment Wizard**: Multi-step form to create and track shipments
- **Supplier Performance Dashboard**: Visualize rankings, trends, metrics
- **Route Configuration**: Add OSP routes to React router

### Phase 5: Testing (PENDING)
**Scope**: Comprehensive test coverage
- Unit tests for OSPService, OSPShipmentService, SupplierPerformanceService
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Workflow tests for complete OSP lifecycle
- Database tests for schema integrity

### Phase 6: Documentation (PENDING)
**Scope**: Administrative and user documentation
- Administrator's Guide: System setup, configuration, user management
- User Manual: How to use OSP operations system
- API Documentation: Endpoint reference, request/response examples
- Database Schema Documentation: Model descriptions and relationships

### Phase 7: PR and Merge (PENDING)
**Scope**: Code review and integration
- Create pull request for Issue #59
- Run tests and validation
- Merge to main branch
- Close GitHub issue

## Architectural Decisions

### ERP Integration Pattern
Per user request, the system is designed to **rely on ERP systems for procurement/sourcing/costing functions**:
- OSPOperation tracks ERP-provided estimated costs (from PO)
- OSPOperation tracks actual costs (from supplier invoices)
- SupplierPerformanceMetric integrates with ERP cost data
- No internal PO creation - PO management remains in ERP
- System acts as tracking layer for external processing operations

### Data Flow
1. **Operation Setup**: Mark operations as OSP-capable, identify qualified suppliers
2. **OSP Decision**: Select supplier and create OSP operation
3. **Shipment**: Track outbound and inbound shipments
4. **Inspection**: Record quality results on return
5. **Metrics**: Track supplier performance for future decisions
6. **ERP Integration**: Status updates flow back to ERP system (future phase)
