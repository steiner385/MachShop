## 🚨 Critical Issue Categories

### 🔥 High Priority (Immediate Action Required)

1. **Infrastructure Stability Issues**
   - Database state management: Test data conflicts causing routing creation failures
   - Server crashes: Backend crashes during extended test runs  
   - Authentication token handling: "Access token is required" errors

2. **UI Component Failures**  
   - ErrorBoundary crashes: Multiple pages throwing "Cannot read properties of undefined"
   - React component rendering: Components not fully loaded before test assertions
   - Ant Design integration: Selector mismatches with updated component structures

3. **Visual Editor Integration**
   - ReactFlowProvider context: Visual editor control panel not rendering correctly
   - Component hierarchy: Incorrect import/export usage between wrapper components
   - Test selectors: Button elements not found despite implementation

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Important but not blocking)

4. **Feature Implementation Gaps**
   - Routing templates: Template management functionality failing
   - Material traceability: Genealogy search component issues
   - Parameter management: Database constraint violations

5. **Test Code Quality**
   - Selector specificity: Multiple elements matching selectors (strict mode violations)
   - Timing dependencies: Race conditions between component loading and test execution
   - Test data management: Conflicts between test runs due to inadequate cleanup

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fix Strategy

### Phase A: Critical Infrastructure (Priority 1 - ~30 minutes)

1. **Fix Visual Editor ReactFlow Integration**
   - COMPLETED: Fixed VisualRoutingEditor import to use VisualRoutingEditorWrapper
   - STATUS: Partial success - still investigating selector issues

2. **Database Cleanup & Test Isolation**
   - Implement proper test data cleanup between runs
   - Fix routing creation conflicts ("Routing already exists" errors)
   - Add database reset functionality to global setup

3. **ErrorBoundary Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate undefined property access in work instructions
   - Fix materials page component initialization
   - Address equipment page error handling

### Phase B: Authentication & UI Stability (Priority 2 - ~20 minutes)

4. **Authentication Flow Fixes**
   - Fix logout functionality and session management
   - Improve browser back button handling
   - Enhance 401 redirect error handling

5. **Component Visibility Issues**
   - Add proper wait conditions for Ant Design components
   - Implement component ready state checks
   - Update test selectors for current component structure

### Phase C: Feature Completion (Priority 3 - ~15 minutes)

6. **Routing Templates**
   - Debug template management CRUD operations
   - Fix template-to-routing conversion functionality

7. **Material Traceability**
   - Resolve genealogy search component rendering
   - Fix forward/backward traceability workflows

## 📝 Conclusion

The E2E test suite execution has revealed a **mixed but largely positive** picture of the MES system's stability. While core API functionality and business processes (Quality, FAI) are working excellently, there are critical infrastructure and UI component issues that need immediate attention.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage analysis completed
- ✅ Critical issues categorized and prioritized  
- ✅ Specific technical fixes identified and partially implemented
- ✅ Clear roadmap for achieving test stability established

**Immediate Focus Areas:**
1. 🔥 Fix ErrorBoundary crashes blocking page functionality
2. 🔥 Resolve Visual Editor ReactFlow integration
3. ⚠️ Stabilize authentication flows
4. ⚠️ Implement proper test data management

With focused effort on these priority areas, the MES system can achieve >95% test reliability and full feature coverage within the next development sprint.
