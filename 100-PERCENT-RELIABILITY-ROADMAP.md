## Critical Infrastructure Issues Analysis

### 🔴 **Priority 1: Critical (Fix Immediately)**

#### 1.1 Frontend Server Stability Crisis
**Issue**: Multiple HTTP 404 errors and server crashes during execution
**Impact**: Groups 3 & 4 severely affected
**Root Cause**: Vite development server instability under test load

**Solution**:
```typescript
// src/tests/helpers/frontendStabilityManager.ts
export class FrontendStabilityManager {
  private healthCheckInterval = 5000; // 5 seconds
  private maxRecoveryAttempts = 5;
  private circuitBreakerThreshold = 3;

  async monitorFrontendHealth() {
    // Implement health monitoring with exponential backoff
    // Add process-level recovery mechanisms
    // Implement graceful degradation for test execution
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Database Constraint Violations
**Issue**: Foreign key constraint errors in ProductService operations
**Impact**: Groups 1 & 4 test failures
**Root Cause**: Missing existence validation before database operations

**Solution**: Extend defensive validation pattern system-wide
```typescript
// Apply to ALL ProductService methods
async updateConfigurationOption(optionId: string, data: any) {
  // Check existence BEFORE any operation
  const existing = await this.prisma.configurationOption.findUnique({
    where: { id: optionId }
  });
  if (!existing) {
    throw new Error(`Configuration option with ID ${optionId} not found`);
  }
  // Proceed with update...
}
```

### 🟡 **Priority 2: High (Fix This Week)**

#### 2.1 Authentication System Failures
**Issue**: API login failures with HTTP 401 errors
**Impact**: Group 4 (auth-tests, api-tests) 42% success rate
**Root Cause**: Authentication token expiration and user state conflicts

**Solution**: Implement robust auth management
```typescript
// src/tests/helpers/authenticationManager.ts
export class AuthenticationManager {
  async ensureValidAuthentication(user: string) {
    // Check token validity before each test
    // Refresh tokens proactively
    // Handle concurrent auth requests safely
  }
}
```

### 🟠 **Priority 3: Medium (Fix Next Week)**

#### 3.1 Parameter Validation Failures
**Issue**: "undefined" parameter errors in APIs
**Impact**: Groups 1 & 3 business logic failures

#### 3.2 Business Logic Conflicts
**Issue**: Circular reference detection errors
**Impact**: Work order and operation management failures
