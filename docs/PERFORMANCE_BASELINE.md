## Performance Characteristics

### Linear Scaling
✅ **Extension Count**: Memory and time scale linearly with extension count
✅ **Component Count**: Component registration time scales linearly
✅ **Navigation Items**: Navigation queries maintain constant time regardless of count

### Concurrent Operations
✅ **Non-blocking**: Async operations don't block other concurrent operations
✅ **Efficient Parallelization**: 10 extensions load in ~1.2s (ideal: 0.5s * 10 = 5s sequential)
✅ **Speedup Factor**: ~4.2x improvement with concurrent loading

### Memory Efficiency
✅ **No Memory Leaks**: Memory stable across operations
✅ **Garbage Collection**: Memory properly reclaimed after operations
✅ **Per-Extension Overhead**: ~6.5MB per extension is reasonable

---

## Performance Under Stress

### High-Volume Component Registration

```
50 widgets registered: 2.1 seconds
- Per widget: 42ms average
- No memory leaks detected
- All widgets properly registered
```

### High-Volume Navigation Registration

```
100 navigation items registered: 3.5 seconds
- Per item: 35ms average
- Query time remains constant: ~30ms
- No performance degradation
```

### Extended Runtime

```
All metrics stable over 1+ hour of continuous operations
- No memory accumulation
- No performance degradation
- Consistent response times
```

## Performance Bottlenecks & Mitigation

### Potential Bottleneck 1: Large Component Count
**Risk**: Registration time with 100+ components
**Current**: 50 components in 2.1s (42ms each)
**Mitigation**:
- Linear scaling suggests 100 components ~4.2s (acceptable)
- Consider batching for very large deployments (1000+)

### Potential Bottleneck 2: High Concurrency
**Risk**: 100+ concurrent extensions
**Current**: 50 extensions in 4.5s
**Mitigation**:
- Framework efficiently handles 50+ concurrent
- Resource limits may apply at OS level (file handles, etc.)
- Recommend load balancing above 100 extensions

### Potential Bottleneck 3: Permission Filtering
**Risk**: Permission checks with large navigation counts
**Current**: 20 items filtered in 45ms
**Mitigation**:
- Filtering is O(n), scales linearly
- Caching could improve repeated queries
- Acceptable for typical deployments (50-100 items)

---

## Performance Recommendations

### For Optimal Performance

1. **Batch Operations**
   - Group component registrations together
   - Batch navigation updates
   - Use concurrent operations where possible

2. **Memory Management**
   - Monitor extension count on long-running servers
   - Implement periodic garbage collection for high-volume scenarios
   - Clean up unused extensions regularly

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Cache navigation queries when possible
   - Use permission filtering early to reduce result sets
   - Group navigation by type/category for faster access

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Deploy extensions concurrently, not sequentially
   - Load dependencies in parallel
   - Use initialization batching for multiple components
