## Decision-Making Process

### Types of Decisions

#### 1. Trivial Decisions (No Review Needed)
**Examples**: Documentation fixes, non-functional refactoring, test additions

**Process**:
- Contributor can merge own PR if they have commit rights
- Or maintainer can merge after quick review
- No special approval required

#### 2. Significant Decisions (Standard Review)
**Examples**: New features, non-critical bug fixes, dependency updates

**Process**:
1. Contributor opens PR with detailed description
2. Automatic checks run (tests, linting, security scan)
3. At least 1 maintainer reviews and approves
4. Contributor addresses feedback
5. Maintainer merges

**Timeline**: 1-3 days typical

#### 3. Major Decisions (Architecture Review Board)
**Examples**: New APIs, major refactoring, system architecture changes

**Process**:
1. Contributor proposes design (RFC if appropriate)
2. Architecture Review Board reviews proposal
3. Board provides feedback and guidance
4. Contributor revises based on feedback
5. Board approves or requests changes
6. Implementation reviewed by maintainers
7. Merged after approval

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks typical

#### 4. Critical Decisions (Core Team + Board)
**Examples**: New major version, breaking changes, license changes

**Process**:
1. Proposal created with business case
2. Architecture Review Board evaluates
3. Security Team reviews if applicable
4. Project Lead makes final decision
5. Community notified

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

### Decision Documentation

All major decisions must be documented:
- **Decision Record Format**: Use Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- **Location**: `docs/decisions/` directory
- **Content**: Context, decision, rationale, consequences, alternatives considered
- **Visibility**: Public for transparency
