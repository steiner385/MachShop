#### System Implementation
```javascript
// Automatic life status calculation
const lifeStatus = await llpService.calculateLifeStatus(serializedPartId);
// Returns: current usage, percentage used, retirement due date, alert level
```

### Certification Management

#### Required Certifications
1. **Manufacturing Certification** (AS9100, ISO 9001)
   - Material compliance verification
   - Process control documentation
   - Quality system certification

2. **Installation Certification** (MIL-STD-1530)

3. **Maintenance Certification** (FAR 145)
   - Authorized maintenance organization
   - Procedure compliance verification
   - Inspector qualifications

#### Verification Process
1. Document authenticity verification
2. Certification authority validation
3. Compliance standard mapping
4. Expiration date monitoring

#### System Implementation
```javascript
// Certification status verification
const certStatus = await llpCertificationService.getCertificationStatus(serializedPartId);
// Returns: compliance status, missing certifications, expiring documents
```

## Audit and Reporting Requirements

### Regulatory Reporting

#### FAA Requirements
- **Service Difficulty Reports (SDR)** for premature failures
- **Life-Limited Parts Status Reports** for fleet monitoring
- **Retirement Documentation** for end-of-life disposition

#### EASA Requirements
- **Continuing Airworthiness Monitoring** for in-service performance
- **Component Life Management Reports** for regulatory oversight
- **Safety Recommendation Implementation** tracking

#### Report Generation
```javascript
// Generate regulatory compliance reports
const report = await llpReportingService.generateComplianceReport('FAA', 'PDF');
// Supports: FAA, EASA, IATA, ALL regulatory standards
```

### Audit Trail Requirements

#### Event Documentation
All LLP events must include:
- **Date and time** of occurrence
- **Personnel identification** (who performed)
- **Location** where performed
- **Procedure references** used
- **Results and findings**
