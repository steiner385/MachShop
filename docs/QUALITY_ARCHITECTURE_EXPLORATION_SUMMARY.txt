SCOPE: Understanding existing quality and NCR architecture for CAPA tracking
DEPTH: Comprehensive (645 lines of detailed analysis + 300+ lines of quick reference)

===============================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
===============================================================================

1. EXISTING DATABASE INFRASTRUCTURE (READY)
   - NCR model: Fully implemented with 12 states, dispositions, cost tracking
   - Quality inspection models: Complete (QualityPlan, QualityCharacteristic, QualityMeasurement)
   - CorrectiveAction model: ALREADY DEFINED (caNumber, status, verification fields)
   - Enums: All 5 QMS enums defined (Status, Source, RCA Methods, etc.)
   - State tracking: NCRStateHistory model with complete audit trail
   - Approvals: NCRApprovalRequest model integrated with Issue #147
   - Relations: User relationships, linking to audits, all defined

EXTENSION POINTS FOR CAPA TRACKING
===============================================================================

1. Database Relations (READY TO USE)
   - CorrectiveAction.source → QMSCASource enum
   - CorrectiveAction.sourceReference → NCR number, Audit number, etc.
   - CorrectiveAction.assignedTo → User relation
   - CorrectiveAction.verifiedBy → User relation (for verification)
   - CorrectiveAction.createdBy → User relation
   - CorrectiveAction.auditFindings → AuditFinding[] relation

2. Service Patterns (TO FOLLOW)
   - Copy pattern from QualityService (593 lines)
   - Use PrismaClient dependency injection
   - Delegate to specialized services (like NCRWorkflowEnhancement)
   - Create interfaces for all data structures
   - Use try/catch with logger integration

3. Route Patterns (TO FOLLOW)
   - Follow /api/v2/ncr/* pattern
   - Use Express Router
   - Implement middleware: requireQualityAccess, asyncHandler
   - Return consistent JSON responses
   - Include error handling

4. Frontend Patterns (TO FOLLOW)
   - Ant Design components (Card, Table, Form, Modal, etc.)
   - React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
   - useNavigate from react-router-dom
   - Separate pages and components
   - API service pattern with apiClient

5. Notification Integration (TO USE)
   - NotificationService.createNotification()
   - WorkflowNotificationService for escalations
   - Use relatedEntityType: 'CAPA', relatedEntityId: caId
   - actionUrl for deep linking
   - metadata for custom fields

CONCLUSION
===============================================================================

The MachShop3 codebase has excellent existing infrastructure for CAPA tracking:

STRENGTHS:
  • Complete Prisma schema (CorrectiveAction model already defined)
  • Robust notification system ready for CAPA alerts
  • State machine workflow pattern established
  • Approval workflow integration ready
  • Quality service architecture provides proven patterns
  • Frontend component library (Ant Design) ready to use
  • Type-safe TypeScript throughout

GAPS (Small, addressable):
  • CorrectiveActionService needs implementation
  • CAPA frontend pages need creation
  • RCA methods need service implementation
  • Notification triggers need addition
  • Routes need creation

EFFORT ESTIMATE: 36-54 hours (1-1.5 weeks)
  • 12-18 hours backend services
  • 10-15 hours frontend
  • 11-16 hours testing
  • 3-5 hours documentation

RECOMMENDATION: Start with CorrectiveActionService to establish patterns,
then build frontend pages in parallel with RCA service.
