# Time Entry Management System - Quick Setup Guide

**GitHub Issue #51 - Rapid Deployment Instructions**

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Apply the new schema
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Time Entry Management Settings
AUTO_STOP_CHECK_INTERVAL=60000
DEFAULT_RISK_THRESHOLD=25
MAX_BULK_APPROVAL_SIZE=100
NOTIFICATION_QUEUE_ENABLED=true
```

### 3. Start the Background Services
The auto-stop service will automatically start with your application. Monitor the logs:
```bash
# Look for these log messages
[AutoStopService] Background monitoring started
[TimeEntryNotificationService] Templates initialized
```

### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
# Run the test suite to verify everything works
npm test

# Check that new routes are available
curl http://localhost:3000/api/time-entry-management/health
```

## âš¡ Essential Configuration

### Auto-Approval Thresholds
Navigate to: **Admin â†’ Time Entry Settings â†’ Auto-Approval**

**Recommended Starting Values:**
- **Auto-Approve Threshold**: 25 (low risk)
- **Require Approval Threshold**: 50 (medium risk)
- **Escalation Threshold**: 75 (high risk)

### Auto-Stop Rules
Navigate to: **Admin â†’ Time Entry Settings â†’ Auto-Stop**

**Essential Rules to Create:**

1. **Overtime Prevention**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "12-Hour Limit",
     "maxDuration": 720,
     "behavior": "PROMPT_OPERATOR",
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

2. **Weekend Monitoring**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Weekend Check",
     "dayOfWeek": ["SATURDAY", "SUNDAY"],
     "behavior": "STOP_WITH_CONFIRMATION",
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

### User Permissions
Ensure these roles have proper access:
- **Operators**: Can submit edits, view their history
- **Supervisors**: Can approve/reject edits, view team metrics
- **Managers**: Can configure rules, view system analytics

## ðŸ“± User Access Points

### For Operators
- **Main Interface**: Time Tracking â†’ My Time Entries
- **Submit Correction**: Click "Request Correction" on any entry
- **Check Status**: Time Tracking â†’ Correction History

### For Supervisors
- **Approval Dashboard**: Supervision â†’ Time Entry Approvals
- **Team Metrics**: Supervision â†’ Team Performance
- **Delegation**: Supervision â†’ Approval Settings

### For Admins
- **System Configuration**: Admin â†’ Time Entry Settings
- **Auto-Stop Rules**: Admin â†’ Auto-Stop Configuration
- **Notification Templates**: Admin â†’ Notification Settings

## ðŸ”§ Day-One Customization

### 1. Adjust Risk Scoring
Based on your organization's tolerance:
- **Conservative**: Lower thresholds (15/35/65)
- **Moderate**: Default thresholds (25/50/75)
- **Liberal**: Higher thresholds (35/65/85)

### 2. Configure Business Rules
```javascript
// Example: Stricter rules for payroll accuracy
{
  "maxTimeAdjustment": 15,        // Only 15-minute changes
  "allowCrossDayEdits": false,    // No cross-day edits
  "maxEditsPerDay": 2,            // Max 2 edits per day
  "requireReasonMinLength": 15    // Detailed reasons required
}
```

### 3. Set Up Notifications
Test notification delivery:
```bash
# Send a test notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/time-entry-management/notifications/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "test-user", "type": "EDIT_SUBMITTED"}'
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Auto-Approval Rate**: Should be 60-80% for optimal efficiency
2. **Average Approval Time**: Target <2 hours during business hours
3. **Rejection Rate**: Should be <10% with good user training
4. **Auto-Stop Triggers**: Monitor for patterns indicating issues

### Health Checks
```bash
# System health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/time-entry-management/health

# Check background services
curl http://localhost:3000/api/time-entry-management/services/status
```

## ðŸš¨ Common First-Day Issues

### Issue: Auto-Approvals Not Working
**Solution**: Check that `DEFAULT_RISK_THRESHOLD` is set and restart the service.

### Issue: Notifications Not Sending
**Solution**: Verify email/SMS provider credentials in environment variables.

### Issue: Auto-Stop Not Triggering
**Solution**: Confirm background service is running and configurations are active.

### Issue: Permission Errors
**Solution**: Verify user roles are properly assigned in the database.
