## How to Use This Documentation

### Starting a New Claude Code Session

1. **First, read:** `docs/README.md` (overview)
2. **Then, check:** `docs/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` (current status)
3. **For details:** Reference sprint-specific docs in `docs/sprints/`
4. **For implementation:** Use technical specs in `docs/specs/`

### Session Workflow

```
START SESSION
    ↓
Read PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
    ↓
Find current task (e.g., "1.6 - Update prisma/schema.prisma")
    ↓
Reference relevant spec (e.g., DATABASE_SCHEMA_CHANGES.md)
    ↓
Implement task
    ↓
Check off task in PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
    ↓
Update "Session Notes" with progress
    ↓
END SESSION
```

## Questions?

If you're starting a new Claude Code session and unsure where to begin:
1. Open `docs/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
2. Look at "Quick Status Dashboard"
3. Find the first unchecked task in current sprint
4. Begin work on that task

**The PROGRESS_TRACKER is your source of truth for implementation progress.**
