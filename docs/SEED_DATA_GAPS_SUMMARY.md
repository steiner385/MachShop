## Key Findings

### Data Model Completeness ✅
The schema is exceptionally comprehensive:
- **ISA-95 Compliant:** Full 6-level organizational hierarchy (Enterprise → Site → Area → WorkCenter → WorkUnit → Equipment)
- **Production-Ready:** Complete workflows for work orders, operations, quality, materials, and equipment
- **Compliance-Ready:** 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signature support, audit trails, document management
- **Integration-Ready:** ERP sync, ISA-95 B2M messages, equipment data collection, QIF standards

### Current Seed Coverage Status ⚠️

**Seeded (44 entities):**
- Personnel: 13 users with basic skills and certifications
- Materials: 4 parts with 2 lots and genealogy
- Work Orders: 3 orders with operations and performance data
- Quality: 1 plan with inspection, measurements, NCR, and FAI
- Resources: 1 site with areas, work centers, equipment
- Integration: Basic configuration

**Critical Gaps (27 high-priority entities):**
1. Personnel: Dynamic RBAC, complex certifications, availability scenarios
2. Materials: Lot splits/merges, genealogy chains, quality status transitions
3. Equipment: Maintenance, downtime, performance, data collection
4. Work Orders: Rework flows, split/merge, multi-operation scenarios
5. Scheduling: Constraint management, conflict resolution
6. Setup/Changeover: Setup sheets, parameters, execution
7. Inspection: Inspection plans, execution, approval
8. Quality: Advanced sampling, SPC configuration
9. Tools & Gauges: CNC programs, tool management, calibration
10. Workflows: Automation, approval chains, delegation
11. Documents: Management, versioning, collaboration

## Complex Entities Requiring Test Scenarios

### Highest Complexity (Very High)
1. **Work Orders** - Multi-operation, rework, split/merge scenarios
2. **Material Genealogy** - Multi-generation, split/merge, batch recall
3. **Quality Workflows** - Multi-stage inspection, SPC, trend analysis
4. **Equipment OEE** - Availability, performance, quality calculations
5. **Digital Thread** - Complete traceability from raw material to finished product

### High Complexity
6. **Personnel Skills** - Competency matrix with 3-5 skills per person
7. **CNC Operations** - Parameter dependencies, tool management, program control
8. **Production Scheduling** - Constraint-based with material/equipment/personnel
9. **Approval Workflows** - Multi-approver, conditional, sequential approval chains
10. **Rework/Scrap** - Quality investigation, root cause, corrective action

## Recommendations for Seed Data Framework

### Immediate Priority (Weeks 1-2)
- Extend personnel scenarios (30-50 users with diverse roles)
- Create comprehensive material genealogy scenarios
- Implement 10-15 work orders in all states
- Add rework and scrap workflows
- Create multiple quality plans with different sampling methods

### Short Term (Weeks 3-4)
- Advanced scheduling with constraints
- Equipment downtime and maintenance workflows
- Tool management and calibration scenarios
- Setup sheet and changeover procedures
- Electronic signature and compliance workflows

### Medium Term (Weeks 5-8)
- Workflow automation (NCR, ECO, FAI approval)
- Document management workflows
- Engineering change order lifecycle
- Time tracking and labor costs
- Integration/ERP sync scenarios

### Long Term (Weeks 9+)
- Advanced SPC and statistical analysis
- IoT equipment data collection
- Predictive maintenance baselines
- Multi-site manufacturing scenarios
- Advanced workflow with conditional logic

## Framework Architecture

Recommend implementing a **Seed Data Generation Framework** with:

1. **EntityFactories** - Create realistic, interconnected data
2. **ScenarioBuilders** - Compose complex scenarios from components
3. **DataValidators** - Ensure relationship integrity
4. **GenericGenerators** - Support all 177 models
5. **CrossServiceConsistency** - Ensure microservice data alignment

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks for comprehensive Phase 1 & 2 coverage  
**ROI:** 10-20x reduction in manual test data creation
