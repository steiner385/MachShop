# Time Entry Management & Approvals System

**GitHub Issue #51 Implementation**

## Overview

The Time Entry Management & Approvals System is a comprehensive solution that allows operators to self-correct time entries and provides supervisors with an efficient approval workflow. The system includes auto-approval logic, auto-stop functionality, and a complete notification system.

## Features

### ✅ Operator Self-Correction
- Submit time entry edits with detailed reasons
- Real-time validation and risk assessment
- Auto-approval for low-risk changes
- Preview changes before submission
- Track edit history and status

### ✅ Supervisor Approval Workflow
- Risk-based prioritization of pending approvals
- Bulk approval operations for efficiency
- Detailed review interface with change visualization
- Approval delegation and escalation
- Performance metrics and analytics

### ✅ Auto-Approval Logic
- Configurable risk scoring (0-100 scale)
- Business rule validation
- Automatic approval for low-risk edits
- Audit trail for all decisions

### ✅ Auto-Stop Functionality
- Prevents runaway time entries
- Configurable conditions and thresholds
- Multiple stop behaviors (prompt, confirm, automatic)

- User preferences and quiet hours
- Bulk operation notifications

## Architecture

### Database Schema

The system extends the existing schema with six new models:

```prisma
model TimeEntryEdit {
  id               String           @id @default(cuid())
  editType         EditType
  reason           String
  changedFields    String[]
  originalValues   Json
  newValues        Json
  riskScore        Int              @default(0)
  approvalRequired Boolean          @default(true)
  approvalStatus   ApprovalStatus   @default(PENDING)
  autoApproved     Boolean          @default(false)
  // ... additional fields
}

model TimeEntryApproval {
  id              String           @id @default(cuid())
  timeEntryEditId String
  approvedBy      String
  status          ApprovalStatus
  comments        String?
  // ... additional fields
}

model AutoStopConfiguration {
  id                String           @id @default(cuid())
  name              String
  isActive          Boolean          @default(true)
  conditions        Json
  behavior          AutoStopBehavior
  // ... additional fields
}

// Additional models: TimeEntryBatch, TimeEntryLock, ApprovalDelegation
```

## User Guides

### For Operators

#### How to Submit a Time Entry Correction

1. **Access the Correction Interface**
   - Navigate to Time Tracking → My Time Entries
   - Click "Request Correction" on the entry needing changes

2. **Fill Out the Correction Form**
   - **Edit Type**: Select the type of correction (Correction, Addition, Deletion, etc.)
   - **Reason**: Provide a clear, detailed reason for the change
   - **Changes**: Modify the fields that need correction
   - **Review**: Check the preview of your changes

3. **Submit for Review**
   - Click "Submit Correction"
   - The system will automatically assess risk and may auto-approve low-risk changes
   - You'll receive notifications about the status of your correction

#### Understanding Auto-Approval

Your correction may be automatically approved if:
- ✅ The time change is less than 30 minutes
- ✅ The edit is within the same work shift
- ✅ No overlapping time entries exist
- ✅ The reason is clear and detailed
- ✅ Your edit history shows good patterns

High-risk changes require supervisor approval:
- ⚠️ Large time adjustments (>30 minutes)
- ⚠️ Cross-day edits
- ⚠️ Multiple edits in short timeframe
- ⚠️ Conflicting time entries

#### Auto-Stop Notifications

You may receive auto-stop warnings when:
- Your time entry exceeds configured duration limits
- You're clocked in during non-work hours
- System detects potential forgotten clock-outs

**When you receive an auto-stop warning:**
1. Review your current time entry status
2. Clock out if you've forgotten to do so
3. Submit a correction if needed
4. Contact your supervisor if you need to continue working

### For Supervisors

#### Approval Dashboard Overview

The Supervisor Approval Dashboard provides:
- **Risk-prioritized queue** of pending approvals
- **Bulk approval tools** for efficient processing
- **Performance metrics** and trends
- **Search and filter capabilities**

#### How to Review and Approve Corrections

1. **Access the Approval Dashboard**
   - Navigate to Supervision → Time Entry Approvals
   - View pending approvals sorted by risk score

2. **Review Individual Corrections**
   - Click on an edit to see detailed view
   - **Before/After Comparison**: See exact changes
   - **Risk Assessment**: Review system-calculated risk factors
   - **Edit History**: Check operator's previous correction patterns
   - **Business Impact**: Understand effects on payroll/operations

3. **Make Approval Decisions**
   - **Approve**: Change is acceptable
   - **Reject**: Change is not justified
   - **Request More Info**: Need additional details from operator
   - **Escalate**: Forward to higher approval level

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Select multiple low-risk corrections
   - Apply bulk approval with comments
   - Monitor batch processing results

#### Delegation and Escalation

**Setting up Delegation:**
1. Go to Supervision → Approval Settings
2. Click "Delegate Approval Authority"
3. Choose delegate and time period
4. Set scope of delegation (time limits, types, etc.)

**Escalation Process:**
- High-risk edits may require escalation to managers
- System automatically routes based on configured rules
- Escalated items receive priority notifications

#### Performance Monitoring

Monitor key metrics:
- **Approval Response Time**: Average time to process approvals
- **Auto-Approval Rate**: Percentage automatically approved
- **Risk Distribution**: Breakdown of risk scores
- **Operator Patterns**: Individual correction trends

## Configuration Guide

### Auto-Approval Settings

Configure auto-approval thresholds in the admin panel:

```javascript
// Example configuration
{
  "riskThresholds": {
    "autoApprove": 25,        // Auto-approve if risk ≤ 25
    "requireApproval": 50,    // Require approval if risk > 25
    "requireEscalation": 75   // Escalate if risk > 75
  },
  "businessRules": {
    "maxTimeAdjustment": 30,  // Minutes
    "allowCrossDayEdits": false,
    "maxEditsPerDay": 3,
    "requireReasonMinLength": 10
  },
  "approvalLevels": {
    "level1": ["SUPERVISOR"],
    "level2": ["MANAGER"],
    "level3": ["DIRECTOR"]
