## Getting Started

### Essential Setup Sequence
1. **Organizational Structure**
   - Create Enterprise
   - Create Sites
   - Create Areas
   - Create WorkCenters

2. **User Management**
   - Create Users
   - Assign Roles
   - Configure Permissions
   - Set Site Access

3. **Production Setup**
   - Define Parts and Bills of Material
   - Create Routings and Operations
   - Configure Work Order Sequences
   - Setup Scheduling Rules

4. **Quality Configuration**
   - Define Quality Plans
   - Create Inspection Points
   - Setup Sampling Rules
   - Configure Hold/Release Criteria

### Key Relationships to Understand
- **Site** is the fundamental organizational unit (everything is site-specific)
- **WorkOrder** represents production execution (combines Part + Operation + Routing)
- **Part** is the product/component being manufactured
- **Operation** defines manufacturing steps (combined with Parts via Routing)
- **Equipment** tracks machines and their performance
- **User** represents people and their access/capabilities

## Advanced Features

## API Design Patterns

The database supports multiple API integration patterns:

- **REST APIs** for standard CRUD operations
- **GraphQL queries** for complex data retrieval
- **Event streaming** for real-time updates
- **Batch processing** for bulk operations
- **Webhook integrations** for external system updates

See [Application Integration Patterns](generated/application-integration-patterns.md) for detailed guidance.

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys indexed on all tables
- Foreign keys indexed for relationship traversal
- Frequently queried fields indexed (site, status, dates)
- Composite indices for common filter combinations

### Query Optimization
- Denormalization for frequently accessed data
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Partitioning strategy for large tables
- Archive strategy for historical data

### Scalability
- Designed to scale from 10s to 1000s of users
- Support for large sites (10,000+ parts, 100,000+ work orders)
- Efficient pagination for list operations
- Configurable data retention policies
