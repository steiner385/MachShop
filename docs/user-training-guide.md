## üìö PART 1: OPERATOR TRAINING

### Overview: What's New for Operators

You can now **correct your own time entries** without calling HR or waiting for manual fixes. The system will either auto-approve safe changes or route them to your supervisor for quick review.

### When to Use Time Entry Corrections

‚úÖ **Good Reasons to Submit Corrections:**
- Forgot to clock out at lunch
- Clocked in/out at wrong time due to system issues
- Worked different hours than originally recorded
- Need to change work order or operation codes
- Indirect time was recorded incorrectly

‚ùå **Don't Submit Corrections For:**
- Time you didn't actually work
- Fraudulent time adjustments
- Changes to someone else's time entries

### Step-by-Step: Submitting a Correction

#### Step 1: Access Your Time Entries
1. Log into the MachShop system
2. Navigate to **Time Tracking** ‚Üí **My Time Entries**
3. Find the entry that needs correction
4. Click **"Request Correction"**

#### Step 2: Fill Out the Correction Form

**Edit Type** (Choose one):
- **Correction**: Fix an incorrect time/date
- **Addition**: Add missing time entry
- **Deletion**: Remove incorrect entry
- **Split**: Break one entry into multiple
- **Merge**: Combine multiple entries

**Reason** (Very Important!):
- Be specific and clear
- Example: "Forgot to clock out for lunch, actual end time was 5:30 PM"
- Example: "System error during clock-in, should be 7:00 AM not 7:15 AM"
- Minimum 10 characters required

**Changes**:
- Only modify the fields that need correction
- **Start Time**: When you actually started work
- **End Time**: When you actually stopped work
- **Work Order**: Correct work order number
- **Operation**: Correct operation code
- **Break Times**: Actual break periods

#### Step 3: Review Your Changes
- Check the **"Before/After"** comparison
- Verify all changes are accurate
- Review the **risk assessment** (Low/Medium/High)

#### Step 4: Submit
- Click **"Submit Correction"**
- You'll see a confirmation message
- Check your notifications for approval status

### Understanding Auto-Approval

Your correction will be **automatically approved** if:
- ‚úÖ Time change is less than 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ Edit is within the same work shift
- ‚úÖ No overlapping time entries
- ‚úÖ Clear, detailed reason provided
- ‚úÖ You have a good correction history

Your correction will **require supervisor approval** if:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large time adjustments (over 30 minutes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes cross midnight
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple edits in one day
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Affects overtime calculations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Creates time conflicts

### Tracking Your Corrections

#### Check Correction Status
1. Go to **Time Tracking** ‚Üí **Correction History**
2. Status indicators:
   - üü¢ **Auto-Approved**: Applied immediately
   - üü° **Pending**: Waiting for supervisor review
   - üî¥ **Rejected**: Not approved, reason provided
   - üîµ **More Info Needed**: Supervisor needs clarification

#### If Your Correction is Rejected
1. Read the supervisor's comments carefully
2. Submit a new correction with additional details
3. Contact your supervisor if you have questions

### Auto-Stop Alerts

You may receive **auto-stop alerts** when:
- You've been clocked in for over 12 hours
- You're clocked in during non-work hours
- System detects a potential forgotten clock-out

**When you get an auto-stop alert:**
1. **Check your current status** - Are you still working?
2. **Clock out if needed** - Don't ignore if you forgot
3. **Submit a correction** - If the time is wrong
4. **Contact supervisor** - If you need to continue working

## üëî PART 2: SUPERVISOR TRAINING

### Overview: What's New for Supervisors

You now have a **centralized approval dashboard** that shows all pending time entry corrections from your team. The system prioritizes high-risk changes and provides tools for efficient bulk processing.

### Accessing the Approval Dashboard

1. Log into MachShop
2. Navigate to **Supervision** ‚Üí **Time Entry Approvals**
3. Dashboard shows:
   - **Pending approvals** (sorted by risk)
   - **Team metrics** and trends
   - **Quick action buttons** for bulk operations

### Understanding the Approval Queue

#### Risk-Based Prioritization
- **üî¥ High Risk (75-100)**: Review immediately
  - Large time adjustments
  - Cross-day changes
  - Multiple recent edits from same operator

- **üü° Medium Risk (50-74)**: Review within 2 hours
  - Moderate time changes
  - Affects overtime calculations
  - First-time corrections from operator

- **üü¢ Low Risk (25-49)**: Review within 8 hours
  - Small adjustments
  - Good operator history
  - Clear justification

#### Approval Queue Columns
- **Operator**: Who submitted the correction
- **Original Time**: What was originally recorded
- **Requested Change**: What they want to change it to
- **Reason**: Their explanation
- **Risk Score**: System-calculated risk (0-100)
- **Submitted**: When they submitted it

### Step-by-Step: Reviewing Corrections

#### Individual Review Process

1. **Click on a correction** to open detailed view
2. **Review the changes**:
   - **Before/After comparison**: See exact changes
   - **Reason provided**: Is it clear and reasonable?
   - **Risk factors**: What triggered the risk score?
   - **Operator history**: Pattern of corrections

3. **Make your decision**:
   - **‚úÖ Approve**: Change is justified and accurate
   - **‚ùå Reject**: Change is not acceptable
   - **‚ùì Request More Info**: Need additional details
   - **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Escalate**: Forward to manager for decision

4. **Add comments** (recommended):
   - Explain your decision
   - Provide guidance for future corrections
   - Note any patterns you've observed

#### Decision Guidelines

**Approve When:**
- Reason is clear and believable
- Time adjustment matches the explanation
- No patterns of abuse
- Change doesn't create conflicts

**Reject When:**
- Insufficient or suspicious reason
- Time adjustment seems excessive
- Creates conflicts with other entries
- Pattern of frequent corrections

**Request More Info When:**
- Reason is unclear or incomplete
- Need additional context
- Want to verify with other sources

**Escalate When:**
- Large financial impact
- Potential policy violation
- Complex situation requiring manager input
- Operator has history of issues

### Bulk Operations

#### When to Use Bulk Approval
- Multiple **low-risk corrections** from reliable operators
- **Similar types** of corrections (e.g., all lunch clock-outs)
- **Time-sensitive** situations near payroll deadlines

#### How to Use Bulk Approval
1. **Filter the queue**: Use filters to show similar corrections
2. **Select corrections**: Check boxes for items to approve
3. **Click "Bulk Approve"**: Process all selected items
4. **Add batch comment**: Provide reason for bulk approval
5. **Monitor results**: Review success/failure notifications

‚ö†Ô∏è **Bulk Approval Best Practices:**
- Never bulk approve high-risk items
- Limit to 10-15 corrections at once
- Always add explanatory comments
- Review any failures individually

### Performance Metrics

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Response Time**: How quickly you process approvals
- **Approval Rate**: Percentage of corrections you approve
- **Team Patterns**: Trends in your team's correction requests
- **Risk Distribution**: Mix of high/medium/low risk items

#### Accessing Your Metrics
1. Go to **Supervision** ‚Üí **Team Performance**
2. View metrics for:
   - Last 7 days
   - Last 30 days
   - Custom date ranges

#### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: <2 hours during business hours
- **Approval Rate**: 80-90% (higher may indicate too lenient, lower may indicate too strict)
- **Escalation Rate**: 5-10% of total approvals

### Delegation and Coverage

#### Setting Up Approval Delegation

**When to Use:**
- Vacation or extended absence
- High approval volume periods
- Training new supervisors

**How to Set Up:**
1. Go to **Supervision** ‚Üí **Approval Settings**
2. Click **"Delegate Approval Authority"**
3. Choose:
   - **Delegate**: Who will approve in your absence
   - **Start/End Dates**: Duration of delegation
   - **Scope**: Types of corrections they can approve
   - **Limits**: Maximum risk score they can handle

#### Coverage Best Practices
- Set up delegation **before** you leave
- Brief your delegate on **team-specific patterns**
- **Monitor remotely** if possible
- **Review decisions** when you return

### Managing Problem Patterns

#### Identifying Issues
- **Frequent corrections** from same operator
- **Suspicious timing** (always near deadlines)
- **Vague reasons** or repeated explanations
- **Large adjustments** without clear cause

#### Taking Action
1. **Document patterns** in your notes
2. **Have conversation** with operator about expectations
3. **Escalate to manager** if patterns continue
4. **Consider additional training** for operator
