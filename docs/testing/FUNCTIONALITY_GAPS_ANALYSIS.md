## Category 2: Permission Boundary Violations (Security Gaps)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Security Issues

#### 2.1 Create Work Order Button - Not Properly Restricted
**Status**: ‚ùå SECURITY VIOLATION
**Affected Roles**: Production Operator, Production Supervisor, Production Scheduler

**Current Behavior**:
- "Create Work Order" button is visible and enabled for roles without `workorders.write` permission
- Frontend does not check permissions before rendering action buttons

**Expected Behavior**:
- Button should be disabled or hidden for roles without permission
- Backend API properly rejects unauthorized requests (‚úÖ working)
- Frontend should match backend permission model

**Test Failures**:
```
PROD-OP-PERM-002: CANNOT create new work orders ‚ùå
PROD-SUP-PERM-003: CANNOT create new work orders ‚ùå
SCHED-PERM-003: CANNOT create new work orders ‚ùå
```

**Security Risk**:
- Users without permission can click buttons and receive error messages
- Poor user experience (confusion about permissions)
- Potential for users to attempt unauthorized actions

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Add to WorkOrderList.tsx
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore';

const { hasPermission } = useAuthStore();
const canCreateWorkOrder = hasPermission('workorders.write');

<Button
  type="primary"
  disabled={!canCreateWorkOrder}
  onClick={handleCreate}
>
  Create Work Order
</Button>
```

---

#### 2.2 Admin Functions - Not Properly Guarded
**Status**: ‚ùå SECURITY VIOLATION
**Affected Roles**: Production Operator, Production Supervisor

**Current Behavior**:
- Admin/system configuration links visible to non-admin roles
- No route guards on admin pages
- Users can navigate to admin routes and get 403 errors

**Expected Behavior**:
- Admin menu items hidden from non-admin roles
- Route guards redirect unauthorized users
- Clear permission boundaries

**Test Failures**:
```
PROD-OP-AUTH-002: CANNOT access admin functions ‚ùå
PROD-SUP-AUTH-003: CANNOT access admin or system config ‚ùå
```

**Security Risk**:
- Information disclosure (users see admin options exist)
- Poor UX (users confused about access)
- Potential for privilege escalation attempts

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Add to MainLayout.tsx navigation
{hasRole('System Administrator', 'Plant Manager') && (
  <Menu.Item key="/admin">
    <SettingOutlined />
    <span>Administration</span>
  </Menu.Item>
)}
```

---

#### 2.3 DCMA Inspector - Dashboard Authorization Errors
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFIGURATION ISSUE (not a security risk, but UX problem)

**Current Behavior**:
- DCMA Inspector has `*.read` permission (read-only access to everything)
- Dashboard endpoint requires specific roles: `System Administrator`, `Plant Manager`, `Production Supervisor`, `Production Planner`, `Operator`
- DCMA Inspector gets 403 errors on dashboard API calls

**Expected Behavior**:
- DCMA Inspector should be able to view dashboard (read-only)
- API should check for `dashboard.read` permission instead of hardcoded roles
- READ-ONLY access properly enforced

**Backend Fix Required**:
```typescript
// src/routes/dashboardRoutes.ts
// BEFORE (role-based check):
requireRole(['System Administrator', 'Plant Manager', ...])

// AFTER (permission-based check):
requirePermission('dashboard.read')
```

**Test Warnings** (not failures, but logged):
```
Multiple role authorization failed for dcma.inspector on /dashboard/kpis
Multiple role authorization failed for dcma.inspector on /dashboard/recent-work-orders
```

---

## Category 3: Workflow & Process Gaps

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Workflow Issues

#### 3.1 Material Requirement Planning (MRP) Integration
**Gap Identified**: Test scenarios assume MRP integration exists

**Current State**:
- Work orders created manually
- No automatic material requirement calculation
- No purchase requisition generation

**Expected Functionality** (from test scenarios):
```
PROD-PLAN-INT-001: Create work order with automatic material requirements
PROD-PLAN-INT-002: Generate purchase requisitions for missing materials
WARE-MGR-INT-001: Receive MRP-driven material requests
```

**Business Impact**:
- Manual material planning (inefficient)
- Material shortages not predicted
- No integration with ERP for purchasing

---

#### 3.2 Real-Time Equipment Status Integration
**Gap Identified**: Test scenarios assume equipment integration exists

**Current State**:
- Equipment status manually entered
- No real-time machine data collection
- No automatic downtime tracking

**Expected Functionality** (from test scenarios):
```
PROD-OP-INT-002: Equipment status visible before starting operation
MAINT-TECH-INT-001: Receive automatic alert when equipment fails
PLANT-MGR-RPT-004: View real-time OEE dashboard
```

**Business Impact**:
- No real-time production visibility
- Downtime not automatically captured
- OEE calculations based on manual data

---

#### 3.3 Cross-Site Material Transfers
**Gap Identified**: Multi-site routing scenarios assume transfer workflows exist

**Current State**:
- Single-site system implementation
- No inter-site transfer functionality
- Multi-site routing data model exists but no UI

**Expected Functionality** (from test scenarios):
```
WARE-MGR-WORK-003: Transfer material to another site
LOG-COORD-WORK-001: Coordinate cross-site material shipment
INV-SPEC-WORK-002: Reconcile inventory across multiple sites
```

**Business Impact**:
- Cannot manage multi-site operations
- Manual tracking of cross-site transfers
- Inventory visibility limited to single site

---

#### 3.4 Lot Traceability - Forward and Backward
**Gap Identified**: Complete genealogy tracking not fully implemented

**Current State**:
- Basic lot tracking exists
- Material lot relationships stored
- No UI for visualizing complete genealogy

**Expected Functionality** (from test scenarios):
```
TRACE-WORK-001: Full forward traceability (raw material ‚Üí finished goods)
TRACE-WORK-002: Full backward traceability (finished goods ‚Üí raw materials)
QUAL-ENG-AUDIT-002: Generate traceability report for DCMA audit
```

**Business Impact**:
- Manual traceability investigations (slow)
- Recall procedures inefficient
- Audit preparation time-consuming

---

#### 3.5 Serialization & Unique ID Tracking
**Gap Identified**: Advanced serialization features not implemented

**Current State**:
- Basic serial number storage

SERIAL-INT-001: Scan serial number to retrieve part history
```

**Business Impact**:
- Manual serial number assignment
- No automated label printing
- Serial number conflicts possible

---

## Category 4: Data Model & Backend Issues

### üü° LOW PRIORITY - Technical Debt

#### 4.1 Prisma Schema Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Field name mismatches between services and schema

**Example Found**:
```typescript
// RoutingService.ts:273 uses:
part: { select: { name: true } }

// But Prisma schema has:
model Part {
  partName String  // Not "name"
}
```

**Impact**:
- Backend errors during routing queries
- Runtime crashes when routing feature accessed

**Fix Required**: Audit all services for schema field name usage

---

#### 4.2 Missing Database Indexes
**Gap Identified**: Performance issues likely for large datasets

**Areas of Concern**:
- Work order queries by status and date range (no composite index)
- Material lot queries by part number (not indexed)
- Serial number lookups (not indexed on serialNumber field)

**Test Scenarios That May Fail at Scale**:
```
PROD-PLAN-RPT-001: View work orders summary (large datasets)
TRACE-WORK-001: Material traceability (complex joins)
SERIAL-WORK-003: Search by serial number (table scan)
```

---

## Category 5: Requirements Gaps (Design Clarifications Needed)

### üîµ CLARIFICATION NEEDED

#### 5.1 Electronic Signature Workflow
**Question**: How should multi-level approvals work?

**Test Scenario Assumptions**:
- FAI reports require 2 signatures: Quality Engineer + Quality Inspector
- NCR dispositions require 3 signatures: QE + QI + Customer approval (for aerospace)
- Work instructions require 1 signature: Manufacturing Engineer

**Clarification Needed**:
- Sequential vs. parallel approvals?
- Approval delegation rules?
- Re-approval after document revision?

---

#### 5.2 DCMA Inspector Access Level
**Question**: Should DCMA have truly universal read access?

**Current Implementation**: `*.read` permission (everything)

**Questions**:
- Should DCMA see user passwords/security settings?
- Should DCMA see cost data?
- Should DCMA see proprietary process parameters?
- Should DCMA access be time-limited (audit window only)?

**Recommendation**: Define explicit permission list for DCMA rather than wildcard

---

#### 5.3 Work Order Creation Authority
**Question**: Who can create work orders?

**Current Assumptions** (from test scenarios):
- Production Planner: ‚úÖ YES
- Production Scheduler: ‚ùå NO (can only schedule existing WOs)
- Production Supervisor: ‚ùå NO (supervises execution)
- Manufacturing Engineer: ‚ùå NO (designs processes)

**Clarification Needed**:
- Can supervisors create emergency work orders?
- Can engineers create prototype/R&D work orders?
- What about rework work orders?
