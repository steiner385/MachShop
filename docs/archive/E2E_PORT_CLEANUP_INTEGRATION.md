# E2E Test Port Cleanup Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Integration Status**: ✅ Complete and Active

---

## Executive Summary

Integrated automated port cleanup into the E2E test infrastructure to prevent port conflicts from zombie processes left by failed test runs.

### Problem Solved

**Before Integration:**
- Zombie processes from failed E2E tests would hold ports 3101, 5278, and 5279
- New test runs would fail with "Port in use" errors
- Manual cleanup required (`fuser -k` or `pkill` commands)
- Inconsistent test environment between runs

**After Integration:**
- ✅ Automatic port cleanup before every test run
- ✅ Kills zombie playwright, test:e2e, tsx, and vite processes
- ✅ Verifies all test ports are free before starting servers
- ✅ Non-fatal errors (continues even if cleanup has issues)

---

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/scripts/cleanup-test-ports.sh` (Created)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive port cleanup script that handles all E2E test cleanup tasks

**Features**:
- Kills zombie processes by name pattern (`playwright test`, `test:e2e`)
- Frees ports using `fuser -k` (primary method) with `lsof` fallback
- Verifies all ports are free before exit
- Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure
- Detailed output with checkmarks for each step

**Ports Cleaned**:
- 3101 - Backend E2E server
- 5278 - Frontend E2E server (primary)
- 5279 - Frontend E2E server (fallback)

### 2. `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/src/tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` (Modified)

**Changes**:
- Added `cleanupTestPorts()` function (lines 23-39)
- Calls cleanup at start of `globalSetup()` (line 45)
- Non-fatal error handling (warns but doesn't fail setup)

**Integration Point**:
```typescript
async function globalSetup(config: FullConfig) {
  console.log('Starting global setup for E2E tests...');

  // Clean up any zombie processes and occupied ports from previous test runs
  await cleanupTestPorts();

  // ... rest of setup
}
```

### 3. `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/package.json` (Modified)

**Changes**:
- Added `"test:e2e:cleanup"` npm script (line 22)

**New Script**:
```json
"test:e2e:cleanup": "./scripts/cleanup-test-ports.sh"
```

## Usage

### Automatic Cleanup (Default Behavior)

Port cleanup now runs automatically before every E2E test execution:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
# Output:
# Starting global setup for E2E tests...
# Running port cleanup script...
# === E2E Test Port Cleanup ===
# Killing zombie test processes...
#   ✓ No playwright processes found
#   ✓ Killed test:e2e processes
# Cleaning test ports...
#   ✓ Port 3101 already free
#   ✓ Port 5278 already free
#   ✓ Port 5279 already free
# Verifying ports are free...
#   ✓ All test ports are free
# === Port cleanup completed successfully ===
# Port cleanup completed successfully
# ... (continues with test setup)
```

### Manual Cleanup

If you need to manually clean up ports without running tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:cleanup
```

**Use Cases for Manual Cleanup**:
- After manually killing a test run (Ctrl+C)
- When investigating port conflicts
- Before running tests with a different tool (e.g., Playwright UI)
- After system crashes during test execution

## Technical Details

### Cleanup Script Logic

1. **Kill Zombie Processes by Name**:
   ```bash
   pkill -9 -f "playwright test"
   pkill -9 -f "test:e2e"
   ```

2. **Free Ports Using fuser (Primary)**:
   ```bash
   fuser -k 3101/tcp
   fuser -k 5278/tcp
   fuser -k 5279/tcp
   ```

3. **Fallback to lsof**:
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:3101 | xargs kill -9
   ```

4. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   lsof -i:3101 | grep LISTEN  # Should return nothing
   ```

### Error Handling

**In global-setup.ts**:
- Cleanup errors are **non-fatal** (warns but continues)
- This allows tests to proceed even if cleanup has minor issues
- Rationale: Some environments may not have `fuser` installed, but `lsof` fallback usually works

**In cleanup script**:
- Returns exit code 1 if ports still occupied after cleanup
- Returns exit code 0 on successful cleanup
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Validation Results

**Test Run**: `npm run test:e2e:cleanup`

**Output**:
```
=== E2E Test Port Cleanup ===

Killing zombie test processes...
  ✓ No playwright processes found
  ✓ Killed test:e2e processes

Cleaning test ports...
  ✓ Port 3101 already free
  ✓ Port 5278 already free
  ✓ Port 5279 already free

Verifying ports are free...
  ✓ All test ports are free

=== Port cleanup completed successfully ===
```

**Status**: ✅ Working correctly

## Critical Bug Fix (2025-10-21 - Post-Integration)

### Self-Destructive Cleanup Pattern - FIXED

**Problem Identified**: The initial version of the cleanup script used process name-based killing:
```bash
pkill -9 -f "playwright test"
pkill -9 -f "test:e2e"
```

**Critical Issue**: These commands matched ANY process with "playwright test" or "test:e2e" in the command line, **including the currently running test that invoked the cleanup**. This caused the test to kill itself during global setup, resulting in an apparent "hang" (the process was actually dead).

**Fix Applied**: Removed all process name-based killing. The script now relies solely on port-based cleanup using `fuser -k` and `lsof`, which:
- Only kills processes actually holding the test ports
- Cannot kill the current test (which hasn't started servers yet during global setup)
- Is more precise and safer

**Files Modified**: `/home/tony/GitHub/mes/scripts/cleanup-test-ports.sh` (lines 46-49 removed)

**Result**: ✅ Cleanup now works correctly without killing the test itself

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cleanup script fails with "command not found"

**Cause**: `fuser` not installed on system

**Solution**: Install fuser or rely on lsof fallback:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install psmisc

# The script automatically falls back to lsof if fuser is not available
```

### Issue: Ports still occupied after cleanup

**Cause**: Processes owned by different user or system services

**Solution**: Run manual cleanup with sudo:
```bash
sudo fuser -k 3101/tcp
sudo fuser -k 5278/tcp
sudo fuser -k 5279/tcp
```

### Issue: Global setup still fails with port errors

**Cause**: Race condition - servers starting too quickly after cleanup

**Solution**: Add delay in global-setup.ts after cleanup:
```typescript
await cleanupTestPorts();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // 2 second delay
```
