## Production Notes

### Visual Design Guidelines
- **Branding**: Use consistent MES UI colors and styling throughout
- **Screen Captures**: Use high-resolution displays (1920x1080 minimum) for crisp interface shots
- **Annotations**: Add subtle highlights, arrows, or circles to draw attention to key UI elements
- **Data Realism**: Use realistic production data, not "Lorem Ipsum" or "Test123"
- **Transitions**: Smooth fade transitions between scenes (0.5-1 second)

### Audio Production
- **Narration**: Professional voice talent, clear enunciation, conversational but authoritative tone
- **Music**: Subtle background music, modern/tech vibe, 20% volume vs narration
- **Sound Effects**: Minimal - notification "dings" for alerts, subtle UI clicks

### Pacing Recommendations
- **Opening Hook**: First 15 seconds must grab attention with the problem/value prop
- **Demo Flow**: Show, don't tell - minimize talking heads, maximize UI interaction
- **Timing**: Allow 2-3 seconds for viewers to absorb each screen before transitioning
- **Call to Action**: End each video with clear next step (demo request, contact info, website)

### Distribution Strategy

**By Audience:**
- **Executive/C-Suite**: Scenarios 1, 7 (focus on ROI and strategic value)
- **Engineering**: Scenarios 2, 4, 5 (technical depth, compliance, collaboration)
- **Operations**: Scenarios 3, 6 (daily workflow, ease of use, efficiency)
- **Sales Prospects**: Scenario 1 first, then customize based on industry (aerospace → Scenario 5, discrete manufacturing → Scenarios 2-3)

**Platforms:**
- **Website**: Host all scenarios with playlist navigation
- **YouTube**: Create playlist, optimize titles/descriptions for SEO
- **LinkedIn**: Share 60-second teaser clips with links to full videos
- **Trade Shows**: Loop Scenario 1 on booth displays, have others available on tablets
- **Sales Calls**: Screen share relevant scenarios during discovery/demo calls
