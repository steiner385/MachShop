#### High Priority Flows
- **NCR Investigation Flow**: 4 steps, 60% efficiency
  - User Roles: Quality Engineer
  - Issues: Illogical navigation: /dashboard → /quality/ncrs, Illogical navigation: /quality/ncrs/:id → /traceability/:serialNumber
- **Routing Management Flow**: 3 steps, 70% efficiency
  - User Roles: Manufacturing Engineer
  - Issues: None
- **Traceability Investigation Flow**: 3 steps, 70% efficiency
  - User Roles: Quality Engineer, Quality Inspector
  - Issues: None

### 3. Navigation Accessibility Analysis

| Type | Severity | Description | Test Required |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| KEYBOARD_NAVIGATION | HIGH | Verify all navigation elements support keyboard navigation | Yes |
| ARIA_LABELS | MEDIUM | Navigation should have proper ARIA labels and landmark roles | Yes |
| FOCUS_MANAGEMENT | HIGH | Route changes should manage focus appropriately | Yes |
| SCREEN_READER | HIGH | Navigation should be properly announced to screen readers | Yes |

### 4. Route Depth Analysis

#### Routes by Depth
- **Depth 0**: 19 routes (/, /login, /work-orders...)
- **Depth 1**: 26 routes (/dashboard, /work-orders/create, /work-orders/:id...)
- **Depth 2**: 8 routes (/quality/inspections/create, /quality/inspections/:id, /quality/ncrs/create...)

#### Deep Navigation Routes (Depth > 2)
*No deep navigation routes found*

## Recommendations

### Critical Actions Required
1. **Address 4 high-severity navigation issues** (Navigation Issues)
   - High-severity navigation issues can significantly impact user experience
   - Action: Review and fix placeholder routes and missing navigation elements

### High Priority Actions
1. **Optimize 2 inefficient user flows** (User Experience)
   - Complex navigation flows can frustrate users and reduce productivity
   - Action: Simplify navigation paths and reduce number of clicks for common tasks
1. **Implement comprehensive navigation accessibility** (Accessibility)
   - Navigation must be accessible to all users including those with disabilities
   - Action: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility

### Medium Priority Actions


### Low Priority Actions
1. **Expand user flow analysis coverage** (Coverage)
   - Only 30.2% of routes are covered in defined user flows
   - Action: Define additional user flows to ensure all application areas are optimized

## Best Practices for Navigation Design

### Information Architecture
1. **Flat Hierarchy** - Keep navigation depth to 3 levels or fewer
2. **Logical Grouping** - Group related functionality together
3. **Consistent Patterns** - Use consistent navigation patterns across modules
4. **Clear Labels** - Use descriptive, user-friendly navigation labels

### User Experience
1. **Breadcrumb Navigation** - Implement breadcrumbs for routes deeper than 2 levels
2. **Context Preservation** - Maintain user context when navigating between related pages
3. **Quick Access** - Provide shortcuts for frequently used functions
4. **Progress Indicators** - Show progress in multi-step workflows

### Accessibility
1. **Keyboard Navigation** - Ensure all navigation elements are keyboard accessible
2. **Screen Reader Support** - Implement proper ARIA labels and landmarks
3. **Focus Management** - Manage focus appropriately during navigation
4. **Color Independence** - Don't rely solely on color for navigation cues

### Performance
1. **Code Splitting** - Implement route-based code splitting
2. **Lazy Loading** - Load route components on demand
3. **Prefetching** - Prefetch likely next pages for better performance
4. **Navigation Guards** - Implement efficient route guards and permissions
