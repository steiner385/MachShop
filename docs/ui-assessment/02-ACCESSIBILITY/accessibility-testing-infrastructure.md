### 3. Playwright Configuration Integration
**File**: `playwright.config.ts` (updated)

#### New Project Configuration
```typescript
{
  name: 'accessibility-tests',
  testMatch: '**/accessibility/accessibility-audit.spec.ts',
  timeout: 120000, // Extended for accessibility audits
  use: {
    ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
    actionTimeout: 45000,
    navigationTimeout: 45000,
    extraHTTPHeaders: {
      'X-Test-Mode': 'playwright-e2e',
      'X-Project-Name': 'accessibility-tests'
    }
  }
}
```

#### Features
- **Extended Timeouts**: Accommodates slower accessibility audit processing
- **Chrome Browser**: Consistent environment for accessibility testing
- **Test Mode Headers**: Identifies accessibility test traffic
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Integrates with existing test infrastructure

## Testing Strategy

### Role-Based Access Testing

#### Authentication Pattern
```typescript
async function authenticateAsRole(page: Page, role: string = 'System Administrator') {
  const credentials = getRoleCredentials(role);
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', credentials.username);
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', credentials.password);
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await page.waitForURL('**/dashboard', { timeout: 15000 });
}
```

#### Supported Roles
- System Administrator (full access)
- Plant Manager (broad operational access)
- Production Planner (production scheduling and planning)
- Manufacturing Engineer (engineering and routing)
- Quality Engineer (quality management and NCRs)
- Quality Inspector (inspections and FAI)
- Maintenance Technician (equipment maintenance)

### Violation Categorization

#### Impact Levels
- **Critical**: Blocking issues that prevent accessibility
- **Serious (Moderate)**: Significant barriers for users with disabilities
- **Moderate**: Issues that make tasks difficult but not impossible
- **Minor**: Enhancement opportunities

#### Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Critical Routes**: 0 critical, â‰¤2 serious violations allowed
- **High Priority Routes**: 0 critical, â‰¤5 serious violations allowed
- **Standard Routes**: 0 critical, â‰¤20 total violations allowed
- **Complex Components**: Lenient criteria due to inherent accessibility challenges

### Reporting and Documentation

#### Automated Report Generation
- **JSON Reports**: Detailed violation data with timestamps
- **Console Logging**: Real-time test progress and results
- **File Output**: `docs/ui-assessment/02-ACCESSIBILITY/accessibility-audit-results.json`
- **Summary Statistics**: Pass rates, violation counts, categorization

#### Report Structure
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalTests": 25,
    "passedTests": 20,
    "failedTests": 5,
    "passPercentage": "80.0",
    "totalViolations": 45,
    "totalCritical": 2,
    "generatedAt": "2025-10-31T16:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "results": [
