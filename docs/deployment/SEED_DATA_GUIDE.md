## Quick Start - Seed All Databases

### Option 1: Sequential Seeding (Recommended)

```bash
# From project root
cd /home/tony/GitHub/mes

# Seed in order (Auth first, then others)
cd services/auth && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Auth seeded"
cd ../work-order && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Work Order seeded"
cd ../quality && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Quality seeded"
cd ../material && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Material seeded"
cd ../traceability && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Traceability seeded"
cd ../resource && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Resource seeded"
cd ../reporting && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Reporting seeded"
cd ../integration && npx prisma db seed && echo "‚úÖ Integration seeded"
```

### Option 2: Automated Loop

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# From project root: /home/tony/GitHub/mes

services=(auth work-order quality material traceability resource reporting integration)

for service in "${services[@]}"; do
  echo ""
  echo "üå± Seeding $service service..."
  cd services/$service
  npx prisma db seed
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ $service seeded successfully"
  else
    echo "‚ùå $service seeding failed"
    exit 1
  fi
  cd ../../
done

echo ""
echo "üéâ All 8 microservice databases seeded successfully!"
```

## Verifying Seed Data

### Check Record Counts

```bash
# Auth Service
psql postgresql://mes_auth_user:mes_auth_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_auth_db -c "SELECT 'Users' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM \"User\" UNION ALL SELECT 'Audit Logs', COUNT(*) FROM \"AuditLog\";"

# Work Order Service
psql postgresql://mes_wo_user:mes_wo_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_work_order_db -c "SELECT 'Work Orders' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM work_orders UNION ALL SELECT 'Operations', COUNT(*) FROM work_order_operations;"

# Quality Service
psql postgresql://mes_quality_user:mes_quality_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_quality_db -c "SELECT 'Quality Plans' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM quality_plans UNION ALL SELECT 'Inspections', COUNT(*) FROM quality_inspections UNION ALL SELECT 'NCRs', COUNT(*) FROM ncrs;"

# Material Service
psql postgresql://mes_material_user:mes_material_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_material_db -c "SELECT 'Parts' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM parts UNION ALL SELECT 'Inventory', COUNT(*) FROM inventory UNION ALL SELECT 'Lots', COUNT(*) FROM material_lots;"

# Traceability Service
psql postgresql://mes_trace_user:mes_trace_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_traceability_db -c "SELECT 'Events' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM traceability_events UNION ALL SELECT 'Lot Genealogy', COUNT(*) FROM lot_genealogy;"

# Resource Service
psql postgresql://mes_resource_user:mes_resource_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_resource_db -c "SELECT 'Sites' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM sites UNION ALL SELECT 'Work Centers', COUNT(*) FROM work_centers UNION ALL SELECT 'Products', COUNT(*) FROM products;"

# Reporting Service
psql postgresql://mes_reporting_user:mes_reporting_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_reporting_db -c "SELECT 'KPI Definitions' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM kpi_definitions UNION ALL SELECT 'Dashboards', COUNT(*) FROM dashboards;"

# Integration Service
psql postgresql://mes_integration_user:mes_integration_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_integration_db -c "SELECT 'Endpoints' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM integration_endpoints UNION ALL SELECT 'Sync Jobs', COUNT(*) FROM sync_jobs;"
```

### Use Prisma Studio

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio for any service
cd /home/tony/GitHub/mes/services/auth
npx prisma studio

# Studio will open at http://localhost:5555
# Browse and verify all seeded data
```

---

## Resetting and Re-seeding

### Reset Individual Service

```bash
# Example: Reset auth service
cd /home/tony/GitHub/mes/services/auth
npx prisma db push --force-reset
npx prisma db seed
```

### Reset All Services

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This deletes ALL data in all databases!

services=(auth work-order quality material traceability resource reporting integration)

for service in "${services[@]}"; do
  echo "üîÑ Resetting $service..."
  cd services/$service
  npx prisma db push --force-reset
  npx prisma db seed
  cd ../../
done
```

## Data Relationships

The seed data is designed with realistic cross-service references:

- **Users (Auth)** ‚Üí Referenced by Personnel (Resource), Work Orders, Quality Inspections
- **Work Orders (Work Order)** ‚Üí Referenced by Quality Inspections, Material Transactions, Traceability Events
- **Parts (Resource/Material)** ‚Üí Referenced by Work Orders, Quality Plans, Inventory, Lots
- **Serial Numbers (Material)** ‚Üí Referenced by Traceability, Digital Threads, FAI Reports
- **Work Centers (Resource)** ‚Üí Referenced by Work Orders, Operations, Tools
- **Quality Inspections (Quality)** ‚Üí Referenced by Traceability Events, Electronic Signatures

## Troubleshooting

### Seed Script Fails

1. **Check database connection:**
   ```bash
   psql postgresql://mes_auth_user:mes_auth_password_dev@localhost:5432/mes_auth_db -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

2. **Verify Prisma client is generated:**
   ```bash
   cd services/auth
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Check for schema errors:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma validate
   ```

### Unique Constraint Violations

If you see unique constraint errors, the data may already exist. Use `npx prisma db push --force-reset` to reset.

### Missing Dependencies

If `tsx` is not found:
```bash
npm install -D tsx
```

---

## Next Steps

After seeding all databases:

1. **Start microservices** - Boot up all 8 services to test data access
2. **Test API endpoints** - Verify data through REST APIs
3. **Run integration tests** - Ensure cross-service data integrity
4. **Develop frontend** - Use seeded data for UI development
