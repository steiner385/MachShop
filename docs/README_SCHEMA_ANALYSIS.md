## Questions & Clarifications

### Q: Why is Quality Management 100% seeded but Materials only 63%?
**A:** Quality seed data focuses on inspection workflows (plans, inspections, measurements, FAI), which are fully covered. Material seed data is complete for basic scenarios but missing advanced lot operations (split/merge) and complex genealogy chains.

### Q: Should we implement all 4 phases?
**A:** Yes, but at different priorities. Phase 1-2 are essential for core production testing. Phase 3-4 enhance coverage for workflows and analytics. We recommend rolling this out over 8 weeks in the 4 proposed phases.

### Q: How long will Phase 1 implementation take?
**A:** Estimated 2 weeks with 2 developers, assuming EntityFactory base classes and patterns are established in week 1.

### Q: Can we implement phases in a different order?
**A:** Generally no. Phase 1 (Personnel, Materials, Work Orders) are prerequisites for Phase 2. However, within Phase 2, you could potentially reorder (Scheduling vs. Equipment vs. Setup).

### Q: What's the estimated ROI?
**A:** 10-20x on implementation investment through:
- 80% reduction in manual test data time
- 50% faster test setup
- Improved test reliability
- Faster development cycles
