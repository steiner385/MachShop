## What is a Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?

A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) bridges the gap between enterprise planning systems (ERP) and shop floor operations. It provides real-time visibility and control over manufacturing processes, ensuring that products are manufactured correctly, efficiently, and in compliance with regulations.

### Key MES Functions
- **Production Planning and Scheduling**: What to make, when, and where
- **Work Order Management**: Authorizing and tracking production activities
- **Quality Management**: Ensuring products meet specifications and regulations
- **Material Management**: Tracking raw materials, components, and finished goods
- **Labor Tracking**: Recording who did what work and when
- **Equipment Management**: Monitoring asset performance and maintenance
- **Document Control**: Ensuring workers have current procedures and instructions
- **Traceability**: Complete genealogy tracking for regulatory compliance

## How the Database Enables MES Operations

### 1. **Organizational Foundation**
The database provides a hierarchical structure that supports multi-site manufacturing operations:

```
Enterprise (Global Corporation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sites (Individual Factories)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Areas (Production Floors)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Work Centers (Production Groups)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Work Units (Individual Equipment)
```

**Why This Matters**: Manufacturing companies often have multiple facilities with different processes, equipment, and requirements. This hierarchy allows each site to operate independently while maintaining enterprise-wide visibility and control.

### 2. **Production Orchestration**
The database coordinates complex manufacturing workflows through interconnected entities:

- **Parts**: Define what to manufacture (specifications, drawings, requirements)
- **Work Orders**: Authorize production of specific quantities
- **Routings**: Define the sequence of operations needed
- **Operations**: Standardize how work is performed
- **Scheduling**: Coordinate when and where work happens

**Real-World Example**: When a customer orders 100 turbine blades, the system creates a Work Order linked to the Part definition, follows the established Routing to determine the sequence of machining operations, and schedules work across available Work Centers.

### 3. **Real-Time Visibility**
The database captures real-time data from shop floor operations:

- **Equipment Data**: Temperature, pressure, cycle times from machines
- **Labor Tracking**: Who is working on what, start/stop times

### 2. **Partitioning Opportunities**
- Time-based partitioning for historical data (audit logs, time entries)
- Site-based partitioning for multi-tenant isolation
- Archive strategies for completed work orders and closed documents

### 3. **Caching Patterns**
- Configuration data (site settings, templates) - high read, low write
- User permissions and roles - frequently accessed, occasionally updated
- Active work orders and schedules - high read/write during production

### 4. **Data Archival Strategy**

```
/api/v1/enterprises/{enterpriseId}/sites/{siteId}/workorders
/api/v1/parts/{partId}/quality-plans
/api/v1/users/{userId}/labor-time-entries
/api/v1/equipment/{equipmentId}/performance-data
```

#### **Relationship Navigation**
```typescript
// WorkOrder with related entities
interface WorkOrderResponse {
  id: string;
  workOrderNumber: string;
  part: PartSummary;
  site: SiteSummary;
  assignedTo?: UserSummary;
  routing?: RoutingSummary;
  operations: WorkOrderOperationSummary[];
  qualityInspections: QualityInspectionSummary[];
  laborTimeEntries: LaborTimeEntrySummary[];
}
```

### GraphQL Integration Support
The rich relationship structure supports GraphQL queries:

```graphql
query WorkOrderDetails($id: ID!) {
  workOrder(id: $id) {
    id
    workOrderNumber
    part {
      partNumber
      partName
      qualityPlans {
        planNumber
        characteristics {
          characteristic
          specification
        }
      }
    }
    routing {
      operations {
        operation {
          description
          parameters {
            name
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Data Synchronization Strategies

### Event-Driven Synchronization
```sql
-- Audit tables support event-driven integration
AuditLog -> External systems notified of changes
WorkOrderStatusHistory -> Production status updates
EquipmentStateHistory -> Equipment status changes
MaterialStateHistory -> Inventory level changes
```

### Batch Synchronization Patterns
```sql
-- Scheduled batch exports for reporting systems
SELECT * FROM ProductionPerformanceActual
WHERE createdAt >= LAST_SYNC_TIMESTAMP;

-- Data warehouse ETL patterns
SELECT
  wo.workOrderNumber,
  p.partNumber,
  SUM(lte.hours) as totalHours,
  AVG(qm.measurementValue) as avgQuality
FROM WorkOrder wo
JOIN Part p ON wo.partId = p.id
JOIN LaborTimeEntry lte ON lte.workOrderId = wo.id
JOIN QualityMeasurement qm ON qm.workOrderId = wo.id
WHERE wo.completedAt BETWEEN ? AND ?
GROUP BY wo.id, p.id;
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategies
- **Optimistic Locking**: Version fields on critical entities
- **Audit Trails**: Complete change history for conflict analysis
- **Master Data Management**: Clear ownership of authoritative data
- **Eventual Consistency**: Asynchronous reconciliation processes
