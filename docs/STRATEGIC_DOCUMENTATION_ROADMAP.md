## QUICK WINS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Quick Wins (Can implement in parallel)
1. **ECO + Workflow combo** - Enables change management immediately
2. **Inspection + FAI combo** - Quality system foundation
3. **SOP + Personnel combo** - Training & compliance foundation

### Recommended Tools/Templates
- Use existing table documentation template for consistency
- Create regulatory compliance checklist per table
- Build relationship diagrams for complex families (ECO, Workflow)
- Document example JSON payloads for complex fields

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Quality team unavailable for SPC documentation
  - Mitigation: Use existing SPC implementations as reference
- **Risk**: Regulatory complexity overwhelming
  - Mitigation: Engage compliance officer early, define scope clearly
- **Risk**: Time constraints
  - Mitigation: Focus on Tier 1 for minimum viable coverage

## CONCLUSION

Documenting these 7 strategic tables (plus their 30+ supporting tables) provides:

1. **Immediate Coverage**: Reaches 70% target (minimum)
2. **Maximum Value**: Enables core MES workflows and compliance
3. **Scalable Approach**: Can extend to 80%+ with Phase 2+3
4. **Regulatory Alignment**: Covers ISO 9001, 21 CFR Part 11, AS9102, FDA
5. **Manageable Effort**: 100-120 hours over 4-6 weeks
6. **Team Enablement**: Clear documentation for users across departments

**Recommendation**: Begin Phase 1 immediately (Weeks 1-2) to establish foundation, then proceed to Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4) for comprehensive coverage.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this roadmap with team leads
2. Identify domain experts for each table family
3. Schedule documentation kickoff meeting
4. Allocate resources and timeline
5. Begin Phase 1 documentation
