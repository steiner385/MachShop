    Given I am logged in as a Production Operator
    And a work order "WO-20250116-001" is in "IN_PROGRESS" status
    When I navigate to the work order details page
    And I select operation "10 - Machining"
    And I record the following actuals:
      | Quantity Good | Quantity Scrap | Labor Hours |
      | 95            | 5              | 4.5         |

## Phase 7: Advanced RBAC & Security (6-8 weeks)

### Objective

**RBAC Hierarchy:**
```
User → Roles → Capabilities → Resources → Actions
```

**Example:**
```
User: john.doe
Roles: [Production Operator, Maintenance Technician]
Capabilities:
  - work-order.execute (from Production Operator)
  - work-order.hold (from Production Operator)
  - equipment.maintenance (from Maintenance Technician)
Resources:
  - work-order:WO-20250116-001
  - equipment:MILL-001
Actions:
  - execute, hold (on work order)
  - perform-maintenance, log-downtime (on equipment)
```

**Task 7.1: Capability Definition Framework (2 weeks)**

- [ ] Create capability registry (centralized catalog)
- [ ] Implement capability inheritance (role hierarchy)
- [ ] Add capability constraints (time-based, location-based, conditional)
- [ ] Create capability conflict resolution (deny overrides allow)
- [ ] Implement capability versioning

**Capability Naming Convention:**
```
domain.resource.action

Examples:
work-orders.all.create
work-orders.all.release
work-orders.own.execute      // Only work orders assigned to user
quality.inspections.approve
quality.ncrs.disposition
material.inventory.adjust
equipment.all.calibrate
equipment.critical.maintenance  // Only critical equipment
reports.production.view
reports.quality.export
admin.users.create
admin.roles.assign
```

**Capability Model:**
```typescript
Capability {
  id: UUID
  name: String                    // "work-orders.own.execute"
  displayName: String             // "Execute Assigned Work Orders"
  domain: String                  // "work-orders"
  resource: String                // "own" (owned by user) or "all"
  action: String                  // "execute"
  constraints: Constraint[]
  description: String
  createdAt: Date
}

Constraint {
  type: "time" | "location" | "value" | "approval"
  condition: JSONB               // Flexible condition definition
}
```

**Constraint Examples:**
```json
// Time-based: Only during business hours
{
  "type": "time",
  "condition": {
    "daysOfWeek": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "startTime": "07:00",
    "endTime": "17:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}

// Value-based: Only for work orders < $50,000
{
  "type": "value",
  "condition": {
    "field": "estimatedValue",
    "operator": "<",
    "value": 50000
  }
}

// Approval-required: Needs manager approval
{
  "type": "approval",
  "condition": {
    "approverRole": "Plant Manager",
    "expiresIn": "24h"
  }
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All application actions mapped to capabilities

Description: [Experienced operator with training authority]

Capabilities:
☑ work-orders.own.execute
☑ work-orders.own.view
☑ material.inventory.view
☑ quality.inspections.record
☑ training.operator.conduct    // Custom for this role
☐ work-orders.all.release       // Not granted

Constraints:
  ⚙ work-orders.own.execute
    └─ Time: Business hours only (M-F 7am-5pm)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Role templates available for common job functions
- Custom roles can be created from UI
- Role changes tracked in audit log

**Task 7.3: Resource-Level Access Control (2-3 weeks)**
- [ ] Implement row-level security (RLS) in database
- [ ] Create resource ownership model
- [ ] Add resource sharing and delegation
- [ ] Implement hierarchical access (view parent implies view children)
- [ ] Create resource-level audit logging
- [ ] Add access request workflow

**Resource Ownership:**
```typescript
WorkOrder {
  id: UUID
  owner: User                    // Primary responsible party
  assignedTo: User[]             // Can execute
  observers: User[]              // Can view only
  accessControl: AccessControl
}

AccessControl {
  public: Boolean                // Visible to all
  restrictedTo: Role[]           // Only these roles can view
  shareableBy: Role[]            // Who can grant access to others
}
```

**Row-Level Security (PostgreSQL):**
```sql
-- Policy: Users can only see their own work orders or shared work orders
CREATE POLICY work_order_visibility ON work_orders
  USING (
    owner_id = current_user_id() OR
    current_user_id() = ANY(assigned_to_user_ids) OR
    current_user_id() = ANY(observer_user_ids) OR
    is_admin(current_user_id())
  );

-- Policy: Users can only update work orders they own or are assigned to
CREATE POLICY work_order_update ON work_orders
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    owner_id = current_user_id() OR
    current_user_id() = ANY(assigned_to_user_ids)
  );
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users only see work orders they own, are assigned to, or are observers
- Database-level access control prevents unauthorized queries
- Access delegation tracked in audit log

**Task 7.4: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) (2-3 weeks)**

- [ ] Create policy decision point (PDP) service
- [ ] Implement policy enforcement points (PEP) in API and UI
- [ ] Add policy testing and simulation
- [ ] Create policy conflict detection

**ABAC Policy Example:**
```json
{
  "policyId": "ncr-disposition-approval",
  "description": "NCRs over $10,000 scrap value require manager approval",
  "condition": {
    "resource": "ncr",
    "action": "disposition",
    "rules": [
      {
        "attribute": "ncr.scrapValue",
        "operator": ">",
        "value": 10000
      }
    ]
  },
  "effect": "require-approval",
  "approvers": {
    "roles": ["Plant Manager", "Quality Manager"],
    "minApprovals": 1
  }
}
```

**ABAC Evaluation:**
```typescript
function evaluateAccess(user: User, action: string, resource: Resource, context: Context): Decision {
  const policies = getPoliciesFor(action, resource.type);

  for (const policy of policies) {
    if (evaluateCondition(policy.condition, { user, resource, context })) {
      if (policy.effect === "deny") {
        return { allowed: false, reason: policy.description };
      }
      if (policy.effect === "require-approval") {
        return { allowed: false, requiresApproval: true, approvers: policy.approvers };
      }
    }
  }

  // Default: Check capability
  return { allowed: user.hasCapability(action, resource) };
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Capability Assignment Report: Which capabilities assigned to which roles
- Access Violation Log: Failed access attempts with reasons
- Privilege Escalation Detection: Users with excessive capabilities
- Dormant Account Report: Users who haven't logged in > 90 days
- SOC 2 Compliance Report: Evidence of access controls

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Security dashboard shows real-time access control metrics
- Audit reports exportable for compliance audits
- Access violations trigger automated alerts

**Deliverables:**

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

**Risk 1: ISA-95 Compliance Interpretation**
- **Impact:** High - Incorrect implementation requires rework
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Engage ISA-95 consultant for architecture review in Phase 1, Week 2

**Risk 2: Microservices Data Consistency**
- **Impact:** High - Distributed transactions can fail, leading to data corruption
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Implement Saga pattern with compensating transactions, comprehensive integration testing

**Risk 3: ITAR Compliance Violations**
- **Impact:** Critical - Government penalties, export license revocation
- **Probability:** Low (if implemented correctly)
- **Mitigation:** Engage ITAR compliance legal counsel, implement defense-in-depth controls, regular compliance audits

**Risk 4: SSO Integration Delays**
- **Impact:** Medium - Delays Phase 4, dependencies on IT team
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Early engagement with IT security team, use test IdP (Okta trial) for development

**Risk 5: Kubernetes Operational Complexity**
- **Impact:** Medium - Deployment and operational overhead
- **Probability:** High
- **Mitigation:** Invest in Kubernetes training, consider managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE), start small with non-critical services

### Dependency Management

**External Dependencies:**
- ERP system availability for integration testing (Phase 3)
- PLM system API access (Phase 3)
- Corporate identity provider (Azure AD/Okta) for SSO (Phase 4)
