## SUPPORTING TABLES TO DOCUMENT WITH PRIMARY TABLES

To maximize impact, document these supporting tables alongside primary ones:

| Primary Table | Supporting Tables to Include |
|---|---|
| EngineeringChangeOrder | ECOTask, ECOHistory, ECOAffectedDocument, ECOAttachment, ECOCRBReview, ECORelation |
| WorkflowDefinition | WorkflowInstance, WorkflowStage, WorkflowRule, WorkflowAssignment, WorkflowHistory |
| InspectionPlan | InspectionCharacteristic, InspectionStep, InspectionExecution |
| StandardOperatingProcedure | SOPStep, SOPAcknowledgment, SOPAudit |
| SPCConfiguration | SPCRuleViolation |
| SamplingPlan | SamplingInspectionResult |
| FAIReport | FAICharacteristic, QIFMeasurementResult |

| CNCProgram | ProgramDownloadLog, ProgramLoadAuthorization |
| SetupSheet | SetupStep, SetupParameter, SetupExecution, SetupTool, ToolCalibrationRecord |
| IntegrationConfig | IntegrationLog, ERPMaterialTransaction, ProductionScheduleRequest |

This bundling approach can document 30-40 tables total while focusing on 10 core tables.
