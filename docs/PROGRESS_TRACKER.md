## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
No blockers (project not started)

### Active Risks
1. **Data Migration Risk:** Existing work orders may reference old routing structure
   - **Mitigation:** Test migration on staging with prod-like data

2. **Performance Risk:** Multi-site queries may be slow on large datasets
   - **Mitigation:** Add composite indexes, test with 10K+ routes

3. **Timeline Risk:** Sprint 2 and Sprint 4 are ambitious
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize MVP features, defer nice-to-haves

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Session Notes
**2025-10-19:** Documentation structure created. Ready to begin Sprint 1.

### Key Decisions
- **Database:** Using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (confirmed)
- **State Management:** Zustand for frontend routing state (confirmed)
- **UI Framework:** Ant Design for routing components (confirmed)
- **API Versioning:** All new endpoints under `/api/v1/routings` (confirmed)

### During Work
1. Check off tasks as you complete them: `- [x] Task description`
2. Update progress percentages in sprint headers
3. Add notes in "Session Notes" section with date

### Ending a Session
1. Update "Last Updated" date at top
2. Update "Overall Progress" percentage
3. Document any blockers or risks discovered
4. Note where to continue in next session

### Reporting Progress
- Use "Quick Status Dashboard" for high-level status reports
- Reference task IDs (e.g., "1.6", "2.15") in commit messages
- Update sprint status icons as work progresses
