# Testing New Routing Features
## Sprint 4: Collaborative Routing & Visual Enhancements

## ✅ TypeScript Compilation Status

**Result**: All new routing files compile successfully with **zero errors**!

Verified files:
- ✅ `GanttChartView.tsx` - No errors
- ✅ `RoutingChangedAlert.tsx` - No errors
- ✅ `ActiveUsersIndicator.tsx` - No errors
- ✅ `usePresence.ts` - No errors
- ✅ `useRoutingChangeDetection.ts` - No errors
- ✅ `RoutingDetail.tsx` (modified) - No errors

## Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Presence Tracking (Active Users)

**Backend Test**:
```bash
# Start the server
npm run dev

# Test presence update endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/presence/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "routing",
    "resourceId": "test-routing-1",
    "action": "viewing"
  }'

# Expected Response:
# { "success": true, "message": "Presence updated" }

# Test get presence endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/presence/routing/test-routing-1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Expected Response:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "data": {
#     "resourceId": "test-routing-1",
#     "activeUsers": [...],
#     "viewerCount": 1,
#     "editorCount": 0
#   }
# }
```

**Frontend Test**:
1. Navigate to `/routings` and open any routing
2. Check that ActiveUsersIndicator appears in the routing header
3. Open the same routing in another browser/tab
4. Verify both sessions show each other's presence
5. Close one tab, verify presence disappears after ~60 seconds

### 2. Auto-Refresh with Change Notifications

**Test Scenario**:
1. **User A**: Open routing in Browser 1
2. **User B**: Open same routing in Browser 2
3. **User B**: Modify and save the routing
4. **User A**: Wait 30 seconds
5. **Expected**: Alert appears showing routing was modified by User B
6. **User A**: Click "Reload Latest Version"
7. **Expected**: Routing reloads with User B's changes

**Verification Points**:
- [ ] Alert appears within 30 seconds of change
- [ ] Alert shows correct user who made change
- [ ] Alert shows correct time (e.g., "2 minutes ago")
- [ ] "Reload Latest Version" button works
- [ ] "Continue Working" button dismisses alert
- [ ] Alert doesn't reappear after dismissal (unless version changes again)

### 3. Optimistic Locking

**Test Scenario (Conflict)**:
1. **User A**: Open routing (version 1.0)
2. **User B**: Open same routing (version 1.0)
3. **User B**: Edit step 10, save (routing becomes version 1.1)
4. **User A**: Edit step 20, save
5. **Expected**: Version conflict modal appears
6. **User A**: Click "Reload Latest Version"
7. **Expected**: Gets version 1.1, loses step 20 changes

**Verification Points**:
- [ ] Conflict modal appears on save attempt
- [ ] Modal shows correct version numbers
- [ ] Modal shows who modified and when
- [ ] "Reload Latest Version" works correctly
- [ ] User's attempted changes are shown in modal

### 4. Gantt Chart View

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to routing detail page
2. Click "Steps" tab
3. Click "Gantt Chart" button in view toggle
4. **Expected**: Timeline visualization appears

**Verification Points**:
- [ ] Timeline shows all steps as horizontal bars
- [ ] Time markers show correct durations
- [ ] Critical Path steps are RED
- [ ] Quality Inspection steps are GREEN
- [ ] Optional steps are BLUE
- [ ] Standard steps are GRAY
- [ ] Hover shows step details in tooltip
- [ ] Total duration is calculated correctly
- [ ] Layout is responsive on mobile

### 5. View Toggle

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to routing detail, Steps tab
2. Default view should be "Table View"
3. Click "Graph View" - should show network diagram
4. Click "Gantt Chart" - should show timeline
5. Click "Table View" - should return to table

**Verification Points**:
- [ ] Segmented control shows three options with icons
- [ ] Clicking each option switches view instantly
- [ ] Table view shows draggable steps table
- [ ] Graph view shows dependency network
- [ ] Gantt view shows timeline chart
- [ ] No errors in browser console during switches

### 6. Integration Test (All Features Together)

**Complete Workflow**:
1. **User A**: Opens routing, sees presence indicator (empty)
2. **User B**: Opens same routing
3. **User A**: Sees User B appear in presence indicator
4. **User B**: Switches to Gantt Chart view
5. **User B**: Edits step timing, saves
6. **User A**: After 30s, sees change alert
7. **User A**: Clicks "Continue Working"
8. **User A**: Tries to save own changes
9. **Expected**: Version conflict modal appears
10. **User A**: Reloads, sees User B's changes
11. **User A**: Switches to Graph View
12. **User A**: Sees updated dependency graph

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the routing service tests:
```bash
npm test -- src/tests/services/RoutingService.test.ts
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ should create a new routing
✓ should successfully update when currentVersion matches
✓ should throw VersionConflictError when currentVersion does not match
✓ should update routing without version check if currentVersion not provided
```

### E2E Tests

**Collaborative Routing Tests** (18 tests covering all Sprint 4 features):
```bash
npx playwright test src/tests/e2e/collaborative-routing.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

**Test File**: `src/tests/e2e/collaborative-routing.spec.ts` (481 lines, ✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ COL-PRES (2 tests): Presence tracking - Active users indicator, heartbeat API calls
- ✅ COL-VIEW (3 tests): View toggle - Display options, view switching, Gantt visualization
- ✅ COL-CHANGE (1 test): Change detection - Auto-refresh when routing modified
- ✅ COL-LOCK (2 tests): Optimistic locking - Version conflicts, resolution options
- ✅ COL-INT (2 tests): Integration - All features working together, rapid view switching
- ✅ COL-PERF (2 tests): Performance - Page load time, view switch speed
- ✅ COL-EDGE (2 tests): Edge cases - Empty routings, network errors

**Prerequisites to Run E2E Tests**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend server
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2: Start frontend dev server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Run E2E tests
npx playwright test src/tests/e2e/collaborative-routing.spec.ts
```

**Note**: E2E tests require both servers to be running. Tests will verify:
- Presence tracking heartbeats and display
- View toggle functionality (Table/Graph/Gantt)
- Gantt chart rendering and timeline visualization
- Change detection polling
- Page responsiveness and performance

## Browser Testing

### Recommended Browsers
- Chrome/Chromium (primary)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Responsive Testing
- Desktop: 1920x1080
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Mobile: 375x667

### Accessibility Testing
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast (WCAG AA)

## Performance Testing

### Gantt Chart Performance

Test with various routing sizes:
- [ ] 10 steps - Instant render
- [ ] 50 steps - <1s render
- [ ] 100 steps - <2s render
- [ ] 200 steps - May be slow (pagination recommended)

### Presence Tracking Performance

- [ ] 1 user - No impact
- [ ] 5 users - No impact
- [ ] 10 users - Minimal impact (<100ms)
- [ ] 50 users - Consider Redis upgrade

### Change Detection Performance

- [ ] Polling every 30s - Minimal impact
- [ ] Multiple routings open - Independent polling
- [ ] Network errors - Gracefully handled

## Known Limitations

1. **Presence Tracking**:
   - In-memory storage (single server only)
   - For production with multiple servers, upgrade to Redis
   - 60-second stale timeout (configurable)

2. **Change Detection**:
   - Polling-based (30-second interval)
   - For real-time updates, consider WebSockets
   - Only tracks version changes (not who's editing what)

3. **Gantt Chart**:
   - Sequential execution only (no parallel steps visualization)
   - Recommended max 100 steps for good performance
   - No interactive editing (read-only)

4. **View Toggle**:
   - View preference not persisted across sessions
   - No split-screen mode (one view at a time)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Presence indicator not showing
**Solution**: Check network tab for 401 errors, verify authentication

### Issue: Change alert not appearing
**Solution**: Check console for errors, verify polling is enabled

### Issue: Version conflict modal not showing
**Solution**: Ensure versionConflict state is being set in store

### Issue: Gantt chart bars not visible
**Solution**: Check that steps have timing data, verify CSS loaded

### Issue: View toggle not switching
**Solution**: Check console for component errors, verify imports
