   - Immediate notifications sent to material planners, procurement, and managers
   - Auto-expedite request created due to critical impact
   - Supplier automatically contacted with shortage details
4. **Workflow**:
   - Material planner reviews and approves expedite ($250 fee)
   - Supplier responds with 3-day early delivery commitment
   - System tracks progress: Approved ‚Üí Vendor Contacted ‚Üí In Transit ‚Üí Delivered
5. **Resolution**:
   - Material arrives on time, shortage resolved
   - Complete audit trail maintained
   - Analytics updated for future predictions
